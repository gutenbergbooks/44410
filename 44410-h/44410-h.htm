<h1>CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY<br />
OF ENGLAND<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">FROM HENRY VII. TO GEORGE II.</span></h1>

<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="s08">ON THE STATE OF THE CONSTITUTION UNDER CHARLES II.</span></h2>

<p>It may seem rather an extraordinary position, after the last
chapters, yet is strictly true, that the fundamental privileges
of the subject were less invaded, the prerogative swerved into
fewer excesses, during the reign of Charles II. than perhaps in
any former period of equal length. Thanks to the patriot
energies of Selden and Eliot, of Pym and Hampden, the constitutional
boundaries of royal power had been so well established
that no minister was daring enough to attempt any
flagrant and general violation of them. The frequent session
of parliament, and its high estimation of its own privileges,
furnished a security against illegal taxation. Nothing of this
sort has been imputed to the government of Charles, the first
King of England, perhaps, whose reign was wholly free from
such a charge. And as the nation happily escaped the attempts
that were made after the restoration, to revive the star-chamber
and high-commission courts, there was no means of chastising
political delinquencies, except through the regular tribunals of
justice, and through the verdict of a jury. Ill as the one were
often constituted, and submissive as the other might often be
found, they afforded something more of a guarantee, were it
only by the publicity of their proceedings, than the dark and
silent divan of courtiers and prelates who sat in judgment under
the two former kings. Though the bench was frequently subservient,
the bar contained high-spirited advocates, whose firm
defence of their clients the judges often reproved, but no longer
affected to punish. The press, above all, was in continual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
service. An eagerness to peruse cheap and ephemeral tracts
on all subjects of passing interest had prevailed ever since the
reformation. These had been extraordinarily multiplied from
the meeting of the long parliament. Some thousand pamphlets
of different descriptions, written between that time and the
restoration, may be found in the British Museum; and no
collection can be supposed to be perfect. It would have required
the summary process and stern severity of the court of star-chamber
to repress this torrent, or reduce it to those bounds
which a government is apt to consider as secure. But the
measures taken with this view under Charles II. require to be
distinctly noticed.</p>

<p><i>Effect of the press</i>&mdash;<i>Restrictions upon it before and after the
restoration.</i>&mdash;In the reign of Henry VIII., when the political
importance of the art of printing, especially in the great question
of the reformation, began to be apprehended, it was thought
necessary to assume an absolute control over it, partly by the
king's general prerogative, and still more by virtue of his
ecclesiastical supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
 Thus it became usual to grant by
letters patent the exclusive right of printing the Bible or religious
books, and afterwards all others. The privilege of keeping
presses was limited to the members of the stationers' company,
who were bound by regulations established in the reign of Mary
by the star-chamber, for the contravention of which they incurred
the speedy chastisement of that vigilant tribunal. These
regulations not only limited the number of presses, and of men
who should be employed on them, but subjected new publications
to the previous inspection of a licencer. The long
parliament did not hesitate to copy this precedent of a tyranny
they had overthrown; and by repeated ordinances against
unlicensed printing, hindered, as far as in them lay, this great
instrument of political power from serving the purposes of their
adversaries. Every government, however popular in name or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
origin, must have some uneasiness from the great mass of the
multitude, some vicissitudes of public opinion to apprehend;
and experience shows that republics, especially in a revolutionary
season, shrink as instinctively, and sometimes as reasonably,
from an open licence of the tongue and pen, as the most jealous
court. We read the noble apology of Milton for the freedom of
the press with admiration; but it had little influence on the
parliament to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p><i>Licensing acts.</i>&mdash;It might easily be anticipated, from the
general spirit of Lord Clarendon's administration, that he
would not suffer the press to emancipate itself from these
established shackles.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 A bill for the regulation of printing
failed in 1661, from the Commons' jealousy of the Peers who
had inserted a clause exempting their own houses from search.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>

But next year a statute was enacted, which, reciting the well-government
and regulating of printers and printing-presses to
be matter of public care and concernment, and that by the
general licentiousness of the late times many evil-disposed
persons had been encouraged to print and sell heretical and
seditious books, prohibits every private person from printing
any book or pamphlet, unless entered with the stationers'
company, and duly licensed in the following manner; to wit,
books of law by the chancellor or one of the chief justices, of
history and politics by the secretary of state, of heraldry by the
kings at arms, of divinity, physic or philosophy, by the bishops
of Canterbury or London, or if printed in either university,
by its chancellor. The number of master-printers was limited
to twenty; they were to give security, to affix their names, and
to declare the author, if required by the licencer. The king's
messengers, by warrant from a secretary of state, or the master
and wardens of the stationers' company, were empowered to
seize unlicensed copies wherever they should think fit to search
for them, and, in case they should find any unlicensed book
suspected to contain matters contrary to the church or state,
they were to bring them to the two bishops before mentioned,
or one of the secretaries. No books were allowed to be printed
out of London, except in York and in the universities. The
penalties for printing without licence were of course heavy.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
This act was only to last three years; and after being twice
renewed (the last time until the conclusion of the first session
of the next parliament), expired consequently in 1679; an æra
when the House of Commons were happily in so different a
temper that any attempt to revive it must have proved abortive.
During its continuance, the business of licensing books was
entrusted to Sir Roger L'Estrange, a well-known pamphleteer
of that age, and himself a most scurrilous libeller in behalf of the
party he espoused, that of popery and despotic power. It is
hardly necessary to remind the reader of the objections that
were raised to one or two lines in <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<p><i>Political writings checked by the judges.</i>&mdash;Though a previous
licence ceased to be necessary, it was held by all the judges,
having met for this purpose (if we believe Chief Justice Scroggs)
by the king's command, that all books scandalous to the government
or to private persons may be seized, and the authors or
those exposing them punished: and that all writers of false
news, though not scandalous or seditious, are indictable on that
account.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
 But in a subsequent trial he informs the jury that,
"when by the king's command we were to give in our opinion
what was to be done in point of regulation of the press, we did
all subscribe that to print or publish any news, books, or
pamphlets of news whatsoever is illegal; that it is a manifest
intent to the breach of the peace, and they may be proceeded
against by law as an illegal thing.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
 Suppose now that this thing
is not scandalous, what then? If there had been no reflection
in this book at all, yet it is <i>illicite</i>; and the author ought to be
convicted for it. And that is for a public notice to all people,
and especially printers and booksellers, that they ought to
print no book or pamphlet of news whatsoever without
authority." The pretended libel in this case was a periodical
pamphlet, entitled the <i>Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome</i>;
being rather a virulent attack on popery, than serving the
purpose of a newspaper. These extraordinary propositions
were so far from being loosely advanced, that the court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
king's bench proceeded to make an order, that the book should
no longer be printed or published by any person whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

Such an order was evidently beyond the competence of that
court, were even the prerogative of the king in council as high
as its warmest advocates could strain it. It formed accordingly
one article of the impeachment voted against Scroggs in the next
session.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
 Another was for issuing general warrants (that is,
warrants wherein no names are mentioned) to seize seditious
libels and apprehend their authors.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
 But this impeachment
having fallen to the ground, no check was put to general warrants,
at least from the secretary of state, till the famous judgment
of the court of common pleas in 1764.</p>

<p><i>Instances of illegal proclamations not numerous.</i>&mdash;Those encroachments
on the legislative supremacy of parliament, and
on the personal rights of the subject, by means of proclamations
issued from the privy council, which had rendered former
princes of both the Tudor and Stuart families almost arbitrary
masters of their people, had fallen with the odious tribunal by
which they were enforced. The king was restored to nothing
but what the law had preserved to him. Few instances appear
of illegal proclamations in his reign. One of these, in 1665,
required all officers and soldiers who had served in the armies
of the late usurped powers to depart the cities of London and
Westminster, and not to return within twenty miles of them
before the November following. This seems connected with
the well-grounded apprehension of a republican conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

Another, immediately after the fire of London, directed the
mode in which houses should be rebuilt, and enjoined the lord
mayor and other city magistrates to pull down whatsoever
obstinate and refractory persons might presume to erect upon
pretence that the ground was their own; and especially that no
houses of timber should be erected for the future.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
 Though
the public benefit of this restriction, and of some order as to the
rebuilding of a city which had been destroyed in great measure
through the want of it, was sufficiently manifest, it is impossible
to justify the tone and tenor of this proclamation; and
more particularly as the meeting of parliament was very near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
at hand. But an act having passed therein for the same purpose,
the proclamation must be considered as having had little effect.
Another instance, and far less capable of extenuation, is a
proclamation for shutting up coffee-houses, in December 1675.
I have already mentioned this as an intended measure of Lord
Clarendon. Coffee-houses were all at that time subject to a
licence, granted by the magistrates at quarter sessions. But,
the licences having been granted for a certain time, it was justly
questioned whether they could in any manner be revoked.
This proclamation being of such disputable legality, the judges,
according to North, were consulted, and intimating to the
council that they were not agreed in opinion upon the most
material questions submitted to them, it seemed advisable to
recall it.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 In this essential matter of proclamations, therefore,
the administration of Charles II. is very advantageously compared
with that of his father; and considering at the same time
the entire cessation of impositions of money without consent of
parliament, we must admit that, however dark might be his
designs, there were no such general infringements of public liberty
in his reign as had continually occurred before the long parliament.</p>

<p>One undeniable fundamental privilege had survived the shocks
of every revolution; and in the worst times, except those of the
late usurpation, had been the standing record of primeval
liberty&mdash;the trial by jury: whatever infringement had been
made on this, in many cases of misdemeanour, by the pretended
jurisdiction of the star-chamber, it was impossible, after the bold
reformers of 1641 had lopped off that unsightly excrescence
from the constitution, to prevent a criminal charge from passing
the legal course of investigation through the inquest of a grand
jury, and the verdict in open court of a petty jury. But the
judges, and other ministers of justice, for the sake of their own
authority or that of the Crown, devised various means of
subjecting juries to their own direction, by intimidation, by
unfair returns of the panel, or by narrowing the boundaries of
their lawful function.</p>

<p><i>Juries fined for verdicts.</i>&mdash;It is said to have been the practice
in early times, as I have mentioned from Sir Thomas Smith in
another place, to fine juries for returning verdicts against the
direction of the court, even as to matter of evidence, or to
summon them before the star-chamber. It seems that instances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of this kind were not very numerous after the accession of
Elizabeth; yet a small number occur in our books of reports.
They were probably sufficient to keep juries in much awe. But
after the restoration, two judges, Hyde and Keeling, successively
chief justices of the king's bench, took on them to exercise a
pretended power, which had at least been intermitted in the
time of the commonwealth. The grand jury of Somerset having
found a bill for manslaughter instead of murder, against the
advice of the latter judge, were summoned before the court of
king's bench, and dismissed with a reprimand instead of a fine.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>

In other cases fines were set on petty juries for acquittals against
the judge's direction. This unusual and dangerous inroad on so
important a right attracted the notice of the House of Commons;
and a committee was appointed, who reported some strong
resolutions against Keeling for illegal and arbitrary proceedings
in his office, the last of which was, that he be brought to trial,
in order to condign punishment, in such manner as the house
should deem expedient. But the chief justice, having requested
to be heard at the bar, so far extenuated his offence
that the house, after resolving that the practice of fining or
imprisoning jurors is illegal, came to a second resolution to
proceed no farther against him.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Question of their right to return a general verdict.</i>&mdash;The precedents,
however, which these judges endeavoured to establish,
were repelled in a more decisive manner than by a resolution of
the House of Commons. For in two cases, where the fines thus
imposed upon jurors had been estreated into the exchequer,
Hale, then chief baron, with the advice of most of the judges of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
England, as he informs us, stayed process; and in a subsequent
case it was resolved by all the judges, except one, that it was
against law to fine a jury for giving a verdict contrary to
the court's direction. Yet notwithstanding this very recent
determination, the recorder of London, in 1670, upon the
acquittal of the quakers, Penn and Mead, on an indictment for
an unlawful assembly, imposed a fine of forty marks on each of
the jury.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
 Bushell, one of their number, being committed for
non-payment of this fine, sued his writ of habeas corpus from
the court of common pleas; and on the return made that he
had been committed for finding a verdict against full and
manifest evidence, and against the direction of the court, Chief
Justice Vaughan held the ground to be insufficient, and discharged
the party. In his reported judgment on this occasion,
he maintains the practice of fining jurors, merely on this account,
to be comparatively recent, and clearly against law.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
 No later
instance of it is recorded; and perhaps it can only be ascribed to
the violence that still prevailed in the House of Commons against
nonconformists, that the recorder escaped its animadversion.</p>

<p>In this judgment of the Chief Justice Vaughan, he was led to
enter on a question much controverted in later times, the legal
right of the jury, without the direction of the judge, to find a
general verdict in criminal cases, where it determines not only
the truth of the facts as deposed, but their quality of guilt or
innocence; or as it is commonly, though not perhaps quite
accurately worded, to judge of the law as well as the fact. It
is a received maxim with us, that the judge cannot decide on
questions of fact, nor the jury on those of law. Whenever the
general principle, or what may be termed the major proposition
of the syllogism, which every litigated case contains, can be
extracted from the particular circumstances to which it is
supposed to apply, the court pronounce their own determination,
without reference to a jury. The province of the latter,
however, though it properly extend not to any general decision
of the law, is certainly not bounded, at least in modern times,
to a mere estimate of the truth of testimony. The intention of
the litigant parties in civil matters, of the accused in crimes,
is in every case a matter of inference from the testimony or
from the acknowledged facts of the case; and wherever that
intention is material to the issue, is constantly left for the jury's
deliberation. There are indeed rules in criminal proceedings
which supersede this consideration; and where, as it is expressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the law presumes the intention in determining the offence.
Thus, in the common instance of murder or manslaughter, the
jury cannot legally determine that provocation to be sufficient,
which by the settled rules of law is otherwise; nor can they,
in any case, set up novel and arbitrary constructions of their
own without a disregard of their duty. Unfortunately it has
been sometimes the disposition of judges to claim to themselves
the absolute interpretation of facts, and the exclusive right of
drawing inferences from them, as it has occasionally, though not
perhaps with so much danger, been the failing of juries to make
their right of returning a general verdict subservient to faction
or prejudice. Vaughan did not of course mean to encourage
any petulance in juries that should lead them to pronounce on
the law, nor does he expatiate so largely on their power as has
sometimes since been usual; but confines himself to a narrow,
though conclusive line of argument, that as every issue of fact
must be supported by testimony, upon the truth of which the
jury are exclusively to decide, they cannot be guilty of any legal
misdemeanour in returning their verdict, though apparently
against the direction of the court in point of law; since it
cannot ever be proved that they believed the evidence upon
which that direction must have rested.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Habeas corpus act passed.</i>&mdash;I have already pointed out to the
reader's notice that article of Clarendon's impeachment which
charges him with having caused many persons to be imprisoned
against law.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
 These were released by the Duke of Buckingham's
administration, which in several respects acted on a more liberal
principle than any other in this reign. The practice was not
however wholly discontinued. Jenkes, a citizen of London on
the popular or factious side, having been committed by the
king in council for a mutinous speech in Guildhall, the justices
at quarter sessions refused to admit him to bail, on pretence
that he had been committed by a superior court; or to try him,
because he was not entered in the calendar of prisoners. The
chancellor, on application for a habeas corpus, declined to issue
it during the vacation; and the chief justice of the king's bench,
to whom, in the next place, the friends of Jenkes had recourse,
made so many difficulties that he lay in prison for several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
weeks.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
 This has been commonly said to have produced the
famous act of habeas corpus. But this is not truly stated.
The arbitrary proceedings of Lord Clarendon were what really
gave rise to it. A bill to prevent the refusal of the writ of habeas
corpus was brought into the house on April 10, 1668, but did
not pass the committee in that session.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
 But another to the
same purpose, probably more remedial, was sent up to the Lords
in March 1669-70.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
 It failed of success in the upper house;
but the Commons continued to repeat their struggle for this
important measure, and in the session of 1673-4 passed two bills,
one to prevent the imprisonment of the subject in gaols beyond
the seas, another to give a more expeditious use of the writ of
habeas corpus in criminal matters.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
 The same or similar bills
appear to have gone up to the Lords in 1675. It was not till
1676 that the delay of Jenkes's habeas corpus took place.
And this affair seems to have had so trifling an influence that
these bills were not revived for the next two years, notwithstanding
the tempests that agitated the house during that
period.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
 But in the short parliament of 1679, they appear to
have been consolidated into one, that having met with better
success among the Lords, passed into a statute, and is generally
denominated the habeas corpus act.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>It is a very common mistake, and that not only among
foreigners, but many from whom some knowledge of our constitutional
laws might be expected, to suppose that this statute
of Charles II. enlarged in a great degree our liberties, and forms
a sort of epoch in their history. But though a very beneficial
enactment, and eminently remedial in many cases of illegal
imprisonment, it introduced no new principle, nor conferred
any right upon the subject. From the earliest records of the
English law, no freeman could be detained in prison, except
upon a criminal charge or conviction, or for a civil debt. In
the former case, it was always in his power to demand of the
court of king's bench a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum,
directed to the person detaining him in custody, by which he
was enjoined to bring up the body of the prisoner, with the
warrant of commitment, that the court might judge of its
sufficiency, and remand the party, admit him to bail, or discharge
him, according to the nature of the charge. This writ
issued of right, and could not be refused by the court. It was
not to bestow an immunity from arbitrary imprisonment, which
is abundantly provided in Magna Charta (if indeed it were not
much more ancient), that the statute of Charles II. was enacted;
but to cut off the abuses, by which the government's lust of
power, and the servile subtlety of Crown lawyers, had impaired
so fundamental a privilege.</p>

<p>There had been some doubts whether the court of common
pleas could issue this writ; and the court of exchequer seems
never to have done so.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
 It was also a question, and one of more
importance, as we have seen in the case of Jenkes, whether a
single judge of the court of king's bench could issue it during
the vacation. The statute therefore enacts that where any
person, other than persons convicted or in execution upon legal
process, stands committed for any crime, except for treason or
felony plainly expressed in the warrant of commitment, he
may during the vacation complain to the chancellor, or any of
the twelve judges; who upon sight of a copy of the warrant, or
an affidavit that a copy is denied, shall award a habeas corpus
directed to the officer in whose custody the party shall be,
commanding him to bring up the body of his prisoner within a
time limited according to the distance, but in no case exceeding
twenty days, who shall discharge the party from imprisonment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
taking surety for his appearance in the court wherein his offence
is cognisable. A gaoler refusing a copy of the warrant of commitment
or not obeying the writ is subjected to a penalty of
£100; and even the judge denying a habeas corpus, when
required according to this act, is made liable to a penalty of
£500 at the suit of the injured party. The court of king's bench
had already been accustomed to send out their writ of habeas
corpus into all places of peculiar and privileged jurisdiction,
where this ordinary process does not run, and even to the island
of Jersey, beyond the strict limits of the kingdom of England;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>

and this power, which might admit of some question, is
sanctioned by a declaratory clause of the present statute.
Another section enacts, that "no subject of this realm that
now is, or hereafter shall be, an inhabitant or resiant of this
kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick-upon-Tweed,
shall be sent prisoner into Scotland, Ireland,
Jersey, Guernsey, Tangier, or into parts, garrisons, islands, or
places beyond the seas, which are, or at any time hereafter
shall be, within or without the dominions of his majesty, his
heirs, or successors," under penalties of the heaviest nature
short of death which the law then knew, and an incapacity of
receiving the king's pardon. The great rank of those who were
likely to offend against this part of the statute was, doubtless,
the cause of this unusual severity.</p>

<p>But as it might still be practicable to evade these remedial
provisions by expressing some matter of treason or felony in
the warrant of commitment, the judges not being empowered to
enquire into the truth of the facts contained in it, a further
security against any protracted detention of an innocent man
is afforded by a provision of great importance; that every
person committed for treason or felony, plainly and specially
expressed in the warrant, may, unless he shall be indicted in
the next term, or at the next sessions of general gaol delivery
after his commitment, be, on prayer to the court, released upon
bail, unless it shall appear that the Crown's witnesses could not
be produced at that time; and if he shall not be indicted and
tried in the second term or sessions of gaol delivery, he shall
be discharged.</p>

<p>The remedies of the habeas corpus act are so effectual that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
no man can possibly endure any long imprisonment on a criminal
charge, nor would any minister venture to exercise a sort of
oppression so dangerous to himself. But it should be observed
that, as the statute is only applicable to cases of commitment
on such a charge, every other species of restraint on personal
liberty is left to the ordinary remedy, as it subsisted before this
enactment. Thus a party detained without any warrant must
sue out his habeas corpus at common law; and this is at present
the more usual occurrence. But the judges of the king's bench,
since the statute, have been accustomed to issue this writ during
the vacation in all cases whatsoever. A sensible difficulty has,
however, been sometimes felt, from their incompetency to judge
of the truth of a return made to the writ. For, though in cases
within the statute the prisoner may always look to his legal
discharge at the next sessions of gaol delivery, the same redress
might not always be obtained when he is not in custody of a
common gaoler. If the person therefore who detains any one
in custody should think fit to make a return to the writ of
habeas corpus, alleging matter sufficient to justify the party's
restraint, yet false in fact, there would be no means, at least
by this summary process, of obtaining relief. An attempt was
made in 1757, after an examination of the judges by the House
of Lords as to the extent and efficiency of the habeas corpus at
common law, to render their jurisdiction more remedial.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
 It
failed however, for the time, of success; but a statute has recently
been enacted,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
 which not only extends the power of issuing the
writ during the vacation, in cases not within the act of Charles
II., to all the judges, but enables the judge, before whom the
writ is returned, to enquire into the truth of the facts alleged
therein, and in case they shall seem to him doubtful, to release
the party in custody, on giving surety to appear in the court to
which such judge shall belong, on some day in the ensuing term,
when the court may examine by affidavit into the truth of the
facts alleged in the return, and either remand or discharge the
party, according to their discretion. It is also declared that a
writ of habeas corpus shall run to any harbour or road on the
coast of England, though out of the body of any county; in
order, I presume, to obviate doubts as to the effects of this
remedy in a kind of illegal detention, more likely perhaps than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
any other to occur in modern times, on board of vessels upon
the coast. Except a few of this description, it is very rare for
a habeas corpus to be required in any case where the government
can be presumed to have an interest.</p>

<p><i>Differences between lords and commons.</i>&mdash;The reign of Charles
II. was hardly more remarkable by the vigilance of the House
of Commons against arbitrary prerogative than by the warfare
it waged against whatever seemed an encroachment or usurpation
in the other house of parliament. It has been a peculiar
happiness of our constitution that such dissensions have so
rarely occurred. I cannot recollect any republican government,
ancient or modern (except perhaps some of the Dutch provinces),
where hereditary and democratical authority have been amalgamated
so as to preserve both in effect and influence, without
continual dissatisfaction and reciprocal encroachments; for
though, in the most tranquil and prosperous season of the
Roman state, one consul, and some magistrates of less importance,
were invariably elected from the patrician families,
these latter did not form a corporation, nor had any collective
authority in the government. The history of monarchies,
including of course all states where the principality is lodged
in a single person, that have admitted the aristocratical and
popular temperaments at the same time, bears frequent witness
to the same jealous or usurping spirit. Yet monarchy is unquestionably
more favourable to the co-existence of an hereditary
body of nobles with a representation of the commons than any
other form of commonwealth; and it is to the high prerogative
of the English Crown, its exclusive disposal of offices of trust
which are the ordinary subjects of contention, its power of
putting a stop to parliamentary disputes by a dissolution, and,
above all, to the necessity which both the Peers and the Commons
have often felt, of a mutual good understanding for the maintenance
of their privileges, that we must in a great measure
attribute the general harmony, or at least the absence of open
schism, between the two houses of parliament. This is, however,
still more owing to the happy graduation of ranks, which
renders the elder and the younger sons of our nobility two
links in the unsevered chain of society; the one trained in the
school of popular rights, and accustomed, for a long portion of
their lives, to regard the privileges of the house whereof they
form a part, full as much as those of their ancestors;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
 the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
falling without hereditary distinction into the class of other
commoners, and mingling the sentiments natural to their birth
and family affection, with those that are more congenial to
the whole community. It is owing also to the wealth and
dignity of those ancient families, who would be styled noble
in any other country, and who give an aristocratical character
to the popular part of our legislature, and to the influence
which the peers themselves, through the representation
of small boroughs, are enabled to exercise over the lower
house.</p>

<p><i>Judicial powers of the lords historically traced.</i>&mdash;The original
constitution of England was highly aristocratical. The peers of
this realm, when summoned to parliament (and on such occasions
every peer was entitled to his writ), were the necessary
counsellors and coadjutors of the king in all the functions that
appertain to a government. In granting money for the public
service, in changing by permanent statutes the course of the
common law, they could only act in conjunction with the
knights, citizens, and burgesses of the lower house of parliament.
In redress of grievances, whether of so private a nature as to
affect only single persons or extending to a county or hundred,
whether proceeding from the injustice of public officers or of
powerful individuals, whether demanding punishment as crimes
against the state, or merely restitution and damages to the
injured party, the Lords assembled in parliament were competent,
as we find in our records, to exercise the same high
powers, if they were not even more extensive and remedial, as
the king's ordinary council, composed of his great officers, his
judges, and perhaps some peers, was wont to do in the intervals
of parliament. These two, the Lords and the privy council,
seem to have formed, in the session, one body or great council,
wherein the latter had originally right of suffrage along with
the former. In this judicial and executive authority, the
Commons had at no time any more pretence to interfere than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the council, or the Lords by themselves, had to make ordinances,
at least of a general and permanent nature, which should bind
the subject to obedience. At the beginning of every parliament
numerous petitions were presented to the Lords, or to the king
and Lords (since he was frequently there in person, and always
presumed to be so), complaining of civil injuries and abuse of
power. These were generally indorsed by appointed receivers
of petitions, and returned by them to the proper court whence
relief was to be sought.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
 For an immediate inquiry and remedy
seem to have been rarely granted, except in cases of an extraordinary
nature, when the law was defective, or could not easily
be enforced by the ordinary tribunals; the shortness of sessions,
and multiplicity of affairs, preventing the upper house of
parliament from entering so fully into these matters as the
king's council had leisure to do.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be well questioned, notwithstanding the
considerable opinion of Sir M. Hale, whether the statutes
directed against the prosecution of civil and criminal suits before
the council are so worded as to exclude the original jurisdiction
of the House of Lords, though their principle is very adverse to
it. But it is remarkable that, so far as the Lords themselves
could allege from the rolls of parliament, one only instance
occurs between 4 Hen. IV. (1403) and 43 Eliz. (1602) where their
house had entered upon any petition in the nature of an original
suit; though in that (1 Ed. IV. 1461) they had certainly taken
on them to determine a question cognisable in the common
courts of justice. For a distinction seems to have been generally
made between cases where relief might be had in the courts
below, as to which it is contended by Sir M. Hale that the Lords
could not have jurisdiction, and those where the injured party
was without remedy, either through defect of the law, or such
excessive power of the aggressor as could defy the ordinary
process. During the latter part at least of this long interval,
the council and court of star-chamber were in all their vigour,
to which the intermission of parliamentary judicature may in
a great measure be ascribed. It was owing also to the longer
intervals between parliaments from the time of Henry VI.,
extending sometimes to five or six years, which rendered the
redress of private wrongs by their means inconvenient and uncertain.
In 1621 and 1624, the Lords, grown bold by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
general disposition in favour of parliamentary rights, made
orders without hesitation on private petitions of an original
nature. They continued to exercise this jurisdiction in the first
parliaments of Charles I.; and in one instance, that of a riot
at Banbury, even assumed the power of punishing a misdemeanour
unconnected with privilege. In the long parliament,
it may be supposed that they did not abandon this encroachment,
as it seems to have been, on the royal authority, extending
their orders both to the punishment of misdemeanours and
to the awarding of damages.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
</p>

<p>The ultimate jurisdiction of the House of Lords, either by
removing into it causes commenced in the lower courts, or by
writ of error complaining of a judgment given therein, seems
to have been as ancient, and founded on the same principle of
a paramount judicial authority delegated by the Crown, as that
which they exercised upon original petitions. It is to be
observed that the council or star-chamber did not pretend to
any direct jurisdiction of this nature; no record was ever
removed thither upon assignment of errors in an inferior court.
But after the first part of the fifteenth century, there was a
considerable interval, during which this appellant jurisdiction
of the Lords seems to have gone into disuse, though probably
known to be legal.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
 They began again, about 1580, to receive
writs of error from the court of king's bench; though for forty
years more the instances were by no means numerous. But the
statute passed in 1585, constituting the court of exchequer-chamber
as an intermediate tribunal of appeal between the
king's bench and the parliament, recognises the jurisdiction of
the latter, that is, of the House of Lords, in the strongest terms.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>

To this power, therefore, of determining, in the last resort, upon
writs of error from the courts of common law, no objection could
possibly be maintained.</p>

<p><i>Their pretensions about the time of the restoration.</i>&mdash;The revolutionary
spirit of the long parliament brought forward still higher
pretensions, and obscured all the land-marks of constitutional
privilege. As the Commons took on themselves to direct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
execution of their own orders, the Lords, afraid to be jostled
out of that equality to which they were now content to be
reduced, asserted a similar claim at the expense of the king's
prerogative. They returned to their own house on the restoration
with confused notions of their high jurisdiction, rather
enhanced than abated by the humiliation they had undergone.
Thus before the king's arrival, the Commons having sent up for
their concurrence a resolution that the persons and estates of
the regicides should be seized, the upper house deemed it an
encroachment on their exclusive judicature, and changed the
resolution into "an order of the Lords on complaint of the
Commons."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
 In a conference on this subject between the
two houses, the Commons denied their lordships to possess an
exclusive jurisdiction, but did not press that matter.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
 But in
fact this order was rather of a legislative than judicial nature;
nor could the Lords pretend to any jurisdiction in cases of
treason. They artfully, however, overlooked these distinctions;
and made orders almost daily in the session of 1660, trenching
on the executive power and that of the inferior courts. Not
content with ordering the estates of all peers to be restored,
free from seizure by sequestration, and with all arrears of rent,
we find in their journals that they did not hesitate on petition
to stay waste on the estates of private persons, and to secure the
tithes of livings, from which ministers had been ejected, in the
hands of the churchwardens till their title could be tried.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>

They acted, in short, as if they had a plenary authority in
matters of freehold right, where any member of their own house
was a party, and in every case as full an equitable jurisdiction
as the court of chancery. Though in the more settled state of
things which ensued, these anomalous orders do not so frequently
occur, we find several assumptions of power which show a
disposition to claim as much as the circumstances of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
particular case should lead them to think expedient for the
parties, or honourable to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Resistance made by the commons.</i>&mdash;The lower house of parliament,
which hardly reckoned itself lower in dignity, and was
something more than equal in substantial power, did not look
without jealousy on these pretensions. They demurred to a
privilege asserted by the Lords of assessing themselves in bills
of direct taxation; and, having on one occasion reluctantly
permitted an amendment of that nature to pass, took care to
record their dissent from the principle by a special entry in the
journal.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
 An amendment having been introduced into a bill
for regulating the press, sent up by the Commons in the session
of 1661, which exempted the houses of peers from search for
unlicensed books, it was resolved not to agree to it; and the
bill dropped for that time.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
 Even in far more urgent circumstances,
while the parliament sat at Oxford in the year of the
plague, a bill to prevent the progress of infection was lost,
because the lords insisted that their houses should not be
subjected to the general provisions for security.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
 These ill-judged
demonstrations of a design to exempt themselves from
that equal submission to the law, which is required in all well-governed
states, and had ever been remarkable in our constitution,
naturally raised a prejudice against the Lords, both
in the other house of parliament, and among the common
lawyers.</p>

<p>This half-suppressed jealousy soon disclosed itself in the
famous controversy between the two houses about the case
of Skinner and the East India Company. This began by a
petition of the former to the king, wherein he complained, that
having gone as a merchant to the Indian seas, at a time when
there was no restriction upon that trade, the East India Company's
agents had plundered his property, taken away his ships,
and dispossessed him of an island which he had purchased from
a native prince. Conceiving that he could have no sufficient
redress in the ordinary courts of justice, he besought his
sovereign to enforce reparation by some other means. After
several ineffectual attempts by a committee of the privy council
to bring about a compromise between the parties, the king
transmitted the documents to the House of Lords, with a recommendation
to do justice to the petitioner. They proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
accordingly to call on the East India Company for an answer to
Skinner's allegations. The company gave in what is technically
called a plea to the jurisdiction, which the house over-ruled.
The defendants then pleaded in bar, and contrived to delay the
enquiry into the facts till the next session; when the proceedings
having been renewed, and the plea to the Lords' jurisdiction
again offered, and over-ruled, judgment was finally given that the
East India Company should pay £5000 damages to Skinner.</p>

<p>Meantime the company had presented a petition to the House
of Commons against the proceedings of the Lords in this business.
It was referred to a committee, who had already been appointed
to consider some other cases of a like nature. They made a
report, which produced resolutions to this effect; that the Lords,
in taking cognisance of an original complaint, and that relievable
in the ordinary course of law, had acted illegally, and in a manner
to deprive the subject of benefit of the law. The Lords in
return voted, "that the House of Commons entertaining the
scandalous petition of the East India Company against the Lords'
house of parliament, and their proceedings, examinations, and
votes thereupon had and made, are a breach of the privileges of
the House of Peers, and contrary to the fair correspondency which
ought to be between the two houses of parliament, and unexampled
in former times; and that the House of Peers, taking
cognisance of the cause of Thomas Skinner, merchant, a person
highly oppressed and injured in East India by the governor and
company of merchants trading thither, and over-ruling the plea
of the said company, and adjudging £5000 damages thereupon
against the said governor and company, is agreeable to the laws
of the land, and well warranted by the law and custom of
parliament, and justified by many parliamentary precedents
ancient and modern."</p>

<p>Two conferences between the houses, according to the usage
of parliament, ensued, in order to reconcile this dispute. But
it was too material in itself, and aggravated by too much
previous jealousy, for any voluntary compromise. The precedents
alleged to prove an original jurisdiction in the peers were
so thinly scattered over the records of centuries, and so contrary
to the received principle of our constitution that questions of fact
are cognisable only by a jury, that their managers in the conferences
seemed less to insist on the general right, than on a
supposed inability of the courts of law to give adequate redress
to the present plaintiff; for which the judges had furnished some
pretext on a reference as to their own competence to afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
relief, by an answer more narrow, no doubt, than would have
been rendered at the present day. And there was really more
to be said, both in reason and law, for this limited right of
judicature than for the absolute cognisance of civil suits by the
Lords. But the Commons were not inclined to allow even of
such a special exception from the principle for which they
contended, and intimated that the power of affording a remedy
in a defect of the ordinary tribunals could only reside in the
whole body of the parliament.</p>

<p>The proceedings that followed were intemperate on both sides.
The Commons voted Skinner into custody for a breach of
privilege, and resolved that whoever should be aiding in execution
of the order of the Lords against the East India Company
should be deemed a betrayer of the liberties of the commons of
England, and an infringer of the privileges of the house. The
Lords, in return, committed Sir Samuel Barnardiston, chairman
of the company, and a member of the House of Commons, to
prison, and imposed on him a fine of £500. It became necessary
for the king to stop the course of this quarrel, which was done
by successive adjournments and prorogations for fifteen months.
But on their meeting again in October 1669, the Commons proceeded
instantly to renew the dispute. It appeared that
Barnardiston, on the day of the adjournment, had been released
from custody, without demand of his fine, which by a trick
rather unworthy of those who had resorted to it, was entered
as paid on the records of the exchequer. This was a kind of
victory on the side of the Commons; but it was still more
material that no steps had been taken to enforce the order of
the Lords against the East India Company. The latter sent
down a bill concerning privilege and judicature in parliament,
which the other house rejected on a second reading. They in
return passed a bill vacating the proceedings against Barnardiston,
which met with a like fate. In conclusion, the king
recommended an erasure from the journals of all that had passed
on the subject, and an entire cessation; an expedient which
both houses willingly embraced, the one to secure its victory,
the other to save its honour. From this time the Lords have
tacitly abandoned all pretensions to an original jurisdiction in
civil suits.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
</p>

<p>They have however been more successful in establishing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
branch of their ultimate jurisdiction, which had less to be urged
for it in respect of precedent, that of hearing appeals from courts
of equity. It is proved by Sir Matthew Hale and his editor, Mr.
Hargrave, that the Lords did not entertain petitions of appeal
before the reign of Charles I., and not perhaps unequivocally
before the long parliament.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
 They became very common from
that time, though hardly more so than original suits; and as
they bore no analogy, except at first glance, to writs of error,
which come to the House of Lords by the king's express commission
under the great seal, could not well be defended on legal
grounds. But on the other hand, it was reasonable that the
vast power of the court of chancery should be subject to some
control; and though a commission of review, somewhat in the
nature of the court of delegates in ecclesiastical appeals, might
have been and had been occasionally ordered by the Crown;<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>

yet if the ultimate jurisdiction of the peerage were convenient
and salutary in cases of common law, it was difficult to assign
any satisfactory reason why it should be less so in those which
are technically denominated equitable.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
 Nor is it likely that
the Commons would have disputed this usurpation, in which the
Crown had acquiesced, if the Lords had not received appeals
against members of the other house. Three instances of this
took place about the year 1675; but that of Shirley against Sir
John Fagg is the most celebrated, as having given rise to a
conflict between the two houses, as violent as that which had
occurred in the business of Skinner. It began altogether on the
score of privilege. As members of the House of Commons were
exempted from legal process during the session, by the general
privilege of parliament, they justly resented the pretension of
the peers to disregard this immunity, and compel them to appear
as respondents in cases of appeal. In these contentions neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
party could evince its superiority but at the expense of innocent
persons. It was a contempt of the one house to disobey its order,
of the other to obey it. Four counsel, who had pleaded at the
bar of the Lords in one of the cases where a member of the other
house was concerned, were taken into custody of the serjeant-at-arms
by the speaker's warrant. The gentleman usher of
the black rod, by warrant of the Lords, empowering him to call
all persons necessary to his assistance, set them at liberty. The
Commons apprehended them again; and to prevent another
rescue, sent them to the Tower. The Lords despatched their
usher of the black rod to the lieutenant of the Tower, commanding
him to deliver up the said persons. He replied that they
were committed by order of the Commons, and he could not
release them without their order; just as, if the Lords were to
commit any persons, he could not release them without their
Lordships' order. They addressed the king to remove the lieutenant;
but after some hesitation, he declined to comply with
their desire. In this difficulty, they had recourse, instead of the
warrant of the Lords' speaker, to a writ of habeas corpus returnable
in parliament; a proceeding not usual, but the legality
of which seems to be now admitted. The lieutenant of the
Tower, who, rather unluckily for the Lords, had taken the other
side, either out of conviction, or from a sense that the lower
house were the stronger and more formidable, instead of obeying
the writ, came to the bar of the Commons for directions. They
voted, as might be expected, that the writ was contrary to law
and the privileges of their house. But in this ferment of two
jealous and exasperated assemblies, it was highly necessary, as
on the former occasion, for the king to interpose by a prorogation
for three months. This period, however, not being
sufficient to allay their animosity, the House of Peers took up
again the appeal of Shirley in their next session. Fresh votes
and orders of equal intemperance on both sides ensued, till the
king by the long prorogation, from November 1675 to February
1677, put an end the dispute. The particular appeal of
Shirley was never revived; but the Lords continued without
objection to exercise their general jurisdiction over appeals from
courts of equity.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
 The learned editor of Hale's Treatise on the
Jurisdiction of the Lords expresses some degree of surprise at
the Commons' acquiescence in what they had treated as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
usurpation. But it is evident from the whole course of proceeding
that it was the breach of privilege in citing their own
members to appear, which excited their indignation. It was
but incidentally that they observed in a conference, "that the
Commons cannot find, by Magna Charta, or by any other law
or ancient custom of parliament, that your lordships have any
jurisdiction in cases of appeal from courts of equity." They
afterwards, indeed, resolved that there lies no appeal to the
judicature of the Lords in parliament from courts of equity;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>

and came ultimately, as their wrath increased, to a vote "that
whosoever shall solicit, plead, or prosecute any appeal against
any commoner of England, from any court of equity, before the
House of Lords, shall be deemed and taken a betrayer of the
rights and liberties of the commons of England, and shall be
proceeded against accordingly;"<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
 which vote the Lords resolved
next day to be "illegal, unparliamentary, and tending to a
dissolution of the government."<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
 But this was evidently rather
an act of hostility arising out of the immediate quarrel than the
calm assertion of a legal principle.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Question of the exclusive right of the commons as to money-bills.</i>&mdash;During
the interval between these two dissensions, which
the suits of Skinner and Shirley engendered, another difference
had arisen, somewhat less violently conducted, but wherein both
houses considered their essential privileges at stake. This
concerned the long agitated question of the right of the Lords
to make alterations in money-bills. Though I cannot but think
the importance of their exclusive privilege has been rather
exaggerated by the House of Commons, it deserves attention;
more especially as the embers of that fire may not be so wholly
extinguished as never again to show some traces of its heat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>In our earliest parliamentary records, the Lords and Commons,
summoned in a great measure for the sake of relieving the king's
necessities, appear to have made their several grants of supply
without mutual communication, and the latter generally in a
higher proportion than the former. These were not in the form
of laws, nor did they obtain any formal assent from the king,
to whom they were tendered in written indentures, entered
afterwards on the roll of parliament. The latest instance of
such distinct grants from the two houses, as far as I can judge
from the rolls, is in the 18th year of Edward III.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
 But in
the 22nd year of that reign the Commons alone granted three
fifteenths of their goods, in such a manner as to show beyond
a doubt that the tax was to be levied solely upon themselves.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>

After this time, the Lords and Commons are jointly recited in
the rolls to have granted them, sometimes, as it is expressed,
upon deliberation had together. In one case it is said that the
Lords, with one assent, and afterwards the Commons, granted
a subsidy on exported wool.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
 A change of language is observable
in Richard II.'s reign, when the Commons are recited to grant
with the assent of the Lords; and this seems to indicate, not
only that in practice the vote used to originate with the
Commons, but that their proportion, at least, of the tax being
far greater than that of the Lords (especially in the usual
impositions on wool and skins, which ostensibly fell on the
exporting merchant), the grant was to be deemed mainly theirs,
subject only to the assent of the other house of parliament.
This is, however, so explicitly asserted in a remarkable passage
on the roll of 9 Hen. IV., without any apparent denial, that it
cannot be called in question by any one.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
 The language of the
rolls continues to be the same in the following reigns; the
Commons are the granting, the Lords the consenting power. It
is even said by the court of king's bench, in a year-book of
Edward IV., that a grant of money by the Commons would be
binding without assent of the Lords; meaning of course as to
commoners only, though the position seems a little questionable
even with the limitation. I have been almost led to suspect,
by considering this remarkable exclusive privilege of originating
grants of money to the Crown, as well as by the language of some
passages in the rolls of parliament relating to them, that no
part of the direct taxes, the tenths or fifteenths of goods, were
assessed upon the Lords temporal and spiritual, except where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
they are positively mentioned, which is frequently the case.
But as I do not remember to have seen this anywhere asserted
by those who have turned their attention to the antiquities of our
constitution, it may possibly be an unfounded surmise, or at least
only applicable to the earlier period of our parliamentary records.</p>

<p>These grants continued to be made as before, by the consent
indeed of the houses of parliament, but not as legislative enactments.
Most of the few instances where they appear among the
statutes are where some condition is annexed, or some relief of
grievances so interwoven with them that they make part of a
new law.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
 In the reign of Henry VII. they are occasionally
inserted among the statutes, though still without any enacting
words.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
 In that of Henry VIII. the form is rather more legislative,
and they are said to be enacted by the authority of parliament,
though the king's name is not often mentioned till about
the conclusion of his reign;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
 after which a sense of the necessity
of expressing his legislative authority seems to have led to its
introduction in some part or other of the bill.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
 The Lords and
Commons are sometimes both said to grant, but more frequently
the latter with the former's assent, as continued to be the case
through the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. In the first
parliament of Charles I., the Commons began to omit the name
of the Lords in the preamble of bills of supply, reciting the grant
as if wholly their own, but in the enacting words adopted the
customary form of statutes. This, though once remonstrated
against by the upper house, has continued ever since to be the
practice.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The originating power as to taxation was thus indubitably
placed in the House of Commons; nor did any controversy arise
upon that ground. But they maintained also that the Lords
could not make any amendment whatever in bills sent up to
them for imposing, directly or indirectly, a charge upon the
people. There seems no proof that any difference between the
two houses on this score had arisen before the restoration; and
in the convention parliament the Lords made several alterations
in undoubted money-bills, to which the Commons did not object.
But in 1661, the Lords having sent down a bill for paving the
streets of Westminster, to which they desired the concurrence
of the Commons, the latter, on reading the bill a first time,
"observing that it went to lay a charge upon the people, and
conceiving that it was a privilege inherent in their house that
bills of that nature should be first considered there," laid it
aside, and caused another to be brought in.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
 When this was
sent up to the Lords, they inserted a clause, to which the
Commons disagreed, as contrary to their privileges, because the
people cannot have any tax or charge imposed upon them, but
originally by the House of Commons. The Lords resolved this
assertion of the Commons to be against the inherent privileges of
the House of Peers; and mentioned one precedent of a similar
bill in the reign of Mary, and two in that of Elizabeth, which had
begun with them. The present bill was defeated by the unwillingness
of either party to recede; but for a few years after,
though the point in question was still agitated, instances occur
where the Commons suffered amendments in what were now
considered as money-bills to pass, and others where the Lords
receded from them rather than defeat the proposed measure.
In April 1671, however, the Lords having reduced the amount
of an imposition on sugar, it was resolved by the other house,
"That in all aids given to the king by the Commons, the rate
or tax ought not to be altered by the Lords."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
 This brought
on several conferences between the houses, wherein the limits
of the exclusive privilege claimed by the Commons were discussed
with considerable ability, and less heat than in the disputes
concerning judicature; but, as I cannot help thinking, with a
decided advantage both as to precedent and constitutional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
analogy on the side of the peers.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
 If the Commons, as in early
times, had merely granted their own money, it would be reasonable
that their house should have, as it claimed to have, "a
fundamental right as to the matter, the measure, and the time."
But that the peers, subject to the same burthens as the rest of
the community, and possessing no trifling proportion of the
general wealth, should have no other alternative than to refuse
the necessary supplies of the revenue, or to have their exact
proportion, with all qualifications and circumstances attending
their grant, presented to them unalterably by the other house of
parliament, was an anomaly that could hardly rest on any other
ground of defence than such a series of precedents as establish
a constitutional usage; while, in fact, it could not be made out
that such a pretension was ever advanced by the Commons
before the present parliament. In the short parliament of
April 1640, the Lords having sent down a message, requesting
the other house to give precedency in the business they were
about to matter of supply, it had been highly resented, as an
infringement of their privilege; and Mr. Pym was appointed to
represent their complaint at a conference. Yet even then, in the
fervour of that critical period, the boldest advocate of popular
privileges who could have been selected was content to assert
that the matter of subsidy and supply ought to begin in the
House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
</p>

<p>There seems to be still less pretext for the great extension
given by the Commons to their acknowledged privilege of
originating bills of supply. The principle was well adapted to
that earlier period when security against misgovernment could
only be obtained by the vigilant jealousy and uncompromising
firmness of the Commons. They came to the grant of subsidy
with real or feigned reluctance, as the stipulated price of redress
of grievances. They considered the Lords, generally speaking,
as too intimately united with the king's ordinary council, which
indeed sat with them, and had perhaps, as late as Edward III.'s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
time, a deliberative voice. They knew the influence or intimidating
ascendency of the peers over many of their own
members. It may be doubted in fact whether the lower house
shook off, absolutely and permanently, all sense of subordination,
or at least deference, to the upper, till about the close of the
reign of Elizabeth. But I must confess that, in applying the
wise and ancient maxim, that the Commons alone can empower
the king to levy the people's money, to a private bill for lighting
and cleansing a certain town, or cutting dikes in a fen, to local
and limited assessments for local benefit (as to which the Crown
has no manner of interest, nor has anything to do with the
collection), there was more disposition shown to make encroachments
than to guard against those of others. They began soon
after the revolution to introduce a still more extraordinary
construction of their privilege, not receiving from the House of
Lords any bill which imposes a pecuniary penalty on offenders,
nor permitting them to alter the application of such as have
been imposed below.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
</p>

<p>These restrictions upon the other house of parliament, however,
are now become, in their own estimation, the standing
privileges of the Commons. Several instances have occurred
during the last century, though not, I believe, very lately, when
bills, chiefly of a private nature, have been unanimously rejected,
and even thrown over the table by the speaker, because they
contained some provision in which the Lords had trespassed
upon these alleged rights.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
 They are, as may be supposed,
very differently regarded in the neighbouring chamber. The
Lords have never acknowledged any further privilege than that
of originating bills of supply. But the good sense of both parties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and of an enlightened nation, who must witness and judge of
their disputes, as well as the natural desire of the government to
prevent in the outset any altercation that must impede the
course of its measures, have rendered this little jealousy unproductive
of those animosities which it seemed so happily
contrived to excite. The one house, without admitting the
alleged privilege, has generally been cautious not to give a
pretext for eagerly asserting it; and the other, on the trifling
occasions where it has seemed, perhaps unintentionally, to be
infringed, has commonly resorted to the moderate course of
passing a fresh bill to the same effect, after satisfying its dignity
by rejecting the first.</p>

<p><i>State of the upper house under the Tudors and Stuarts.</i>&mdash;It may
not be improper to choose the present occasion for a summary
view of the constitution of both houses of parliament under the
lines of Tudor and Stuart. Of their earlier history the reader
may find a brief, and not, I believe, very incorrect account in a
work to which this is a kind of sequel.</p>

<p><i>Augmentation of the temporal lords.</i>&mdash;The number of temporal
lords summoned by writ to the parliaments of the house of
Plantagenet was exceedingly various; nor was anything more
common in the fourteenth century than to omit those who had
previously sat in person, and still more their descendants. They
were rather less numerous for this reason, under the line of
Lancaster, when the practice of summoning those who were not
hereditary peers did not so much prevail as in the preceding
reigns. Fifty-three names however appear in the parliament
of 1454, the last held before the commencement of the great
contest between York and Lancaster. In this troublous period
of above thirty years, if the whole reign of Edward IV. is to be
included, the chiefs of many powerful families lost their lives in
the field or on the scaffold, and their honours perished with them
by attainder. New families, adherents of the victorious party,
rose in their place; and sometimes an attainder was reversed
by favour; so that the peers of Edward's reign were not much
fewer than the number I have mentioned. Henry VII. summoned
but twenty-nine to his first parliament, including some
whose attainder had never been judicially reversed; a plain act
of violence, like his previous usurpation of the Crown. In his
subsequent parliaments the peerage was increased by fresh
creations, but never much exceeded forty. The greatest
number summoned by Henry VIII. was fifty-one; which continued
to be nearly the average in the two next reigns, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
very little augmented by Elizabeth. James, in his thoughtless
profusion of favour, made so many new creations, that eighty-two
peers sat in his first parliament, and ninety-six in his latest.
From a similar facility in granting so cheap a reward of service,
and in some measure perhaps from the policy of counteracting
a spirit of opposition to the court, which many of the Lords
had begun to manifest, Charles called no less than one hundred
and seventeen peers to the parliament of 1628, and one hundred
and nineteen to that of November 1640. Many of these honours
were sold by both these princes; a disgraceful and dangerous
practice, unheard of in earlier times, by which the princely
peerage of England might have been gradually levelled with the
herd of foreign nobility. This has occasionally, though rarely,
been suspected since the restoration. In the parliament of 1661,
we find one hundred and thirty-nine lords summoned.</p>

<p>The spiritual lords, who, though forming another estate in
parliament, have always been so united with the temporality
that the suffrages of both upon every question are told indistinctly
and numerically, composed in general, before the
reformation, a majority of the upper house; though there was
far more irregularity in the summonses of the mitred abbots and
priors than those of the barons. But by the surrender and dissolution
of the monasteries, about thirty-six votes of the clergy
on an average were withdrawn from the parliament; a loss ill
compensated to them by the creation of five new bishoprics.
Thus, the number of the temporal peers being continually
augmented, while that of the prelates was confined to twenty-six,
the direct influence of the church on the legislature has
become comparatively small; and that of the Crown, which,
by the pernicious system of translations and other means, is
generally powerful with the episcopal bench, has, in this respect
at least, undergone some diminution. It is easy to perceive
from this view of the case that the destruction of the monasteries,
as they then stood, was looked upon as an indispensable preliminary
to the reformation; no peaceable efforts towards
which could have been effectual without altering the relative
proportions of the spiritual and temporal aristocracy.</p>

<p>The House of Lords, during this period of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, were not supine in rendering their
collective and individual rights independent of the Crown. It
became a fundamental principle, according indeed to ancient
authority, though not strictly observed in ruder times, that
every peer of full age is entitled to his writ of summons at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
beginning of a parliament, and that the house will not proceed
on business, if any one is denied it.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
 The privilege of voting
by proxy, which was originally by special permission of the king,
became absolute, though subject to such limitations as the house
itself may impose. The writ of summons, which, as I have
observed, had in earlier ages (if usage is to determine that which
can rest on nothing but usage) given only a right of sitting in
the parliament for which it issued, was held, about the end of
Elizabeth's reign, by a construction founded on later usage,
to convey an inheritable peerage, which was afterwards adjudged
to descend upon heirs general, female as well as male; an
extension which sometimes raises intricate questions of descent,
and though no materially bad consequences have flowed from
it, is perhaps one of the blemishes in the constitution of parliament.
Doubts whether a peerage could be surrendered to the
king, and whether a territorial honour, of which hardly any
remain, could be alienated along with the land on which it
depended, were determined in the manner most favourable to
the dignity of the aristocracy. They obtained also an important
privilege; first of recording their dissent in the journals
of the house, and afterwards of inserting the grounds of it.
Instances of the former occur not unfrequently at the period
of the reformation; but the latter practice was little known
before the long parliament. A right that Cato or Phocion would
have prized, though it may sometimes have been frivolously or
factiously exercised!</p>

<p><i>State of the commons.</i>&mdash;The House of Commons, from the
earliest records of its regular existence in the 23rd year of
Edward I., consisted of seventy-four knights, or representatives
from all the counties of England, except Chester, Durham, and
Monmouth, and of a varying number of deputies from the cities
and boroughs; sometimes in the earliest period of representation
amounting to as many as two hundred and sixty; sometimes,
by the negligence or partiality of the sheriffs in omitting places
that had formerly returned members, to not more than two-thirds
of that number. New boroughs, however, as being grown
into importance, or from some private motive, acquired the
franchise of election; and at the accession of Henry VIII. we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
find two hundred and twenty-four citizens and burgesses from
one hundred and eleven towns (London sending four), none of
which have since intermitted their privilege.</p>

<p><i>Question as to rights of election.</i>&mdash;I must so far concur with
those whose general principles as to the theory of parliamentary
reform leave me far behind, as to profess my opinion that the
change, which appears to have taken place in the English government
towards the end of the thirteenth century, was founded
upon the maxim that all who possessed landed or movable
property ought, as freemen, to be bound by no laws, and especially
by no taxation, to which they had not consented through
their representatives. If we look at the constituents of a
House of Commons under Edward I. or Edward III., and consider
the state of landed tenures and of commerce at that period,
we shall perceive that, excepting women, who have generally
been supposed capable of no political right but that of reigning,
almost every one who contributed towards the tenths and
fifteenths granted by the parliament, might have exercised the
franchise of voting for those who sat in it. Were we even to
admit, that in corporate boroughs the franchise may have been
usually vested in the freemen rather than the inhabitants, yet
this distinction, so important in later ages, was of little consequence
at a time when all traders, that is all who possessed
any movable property worth assessing, belonged to the former
class. I do not pretend that no one was contributory to a
subsidy, who did not possess a vote; but that the far greater
portion was levied on those who, as freeholders or burgesses,
were reckoned in law to have been consenting to its imposition.
It would be difficult probably to name any town of the least
consideration in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which
did not, at some time or other, return members to parliament.
This is so much the case that if, in running our eyes along the
map, we find any sea-port, as Sunderland or Falmouth, or any
inland town, as Leeds or Birmingham, which has never enjoyed
the elective franchise, we may conclude at once that it has
emerged from obscurity since the reign of Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
</p>

<p>Though scarce any considerable town, probably, was intentionally
left out, except by the sheriffs' partiality, it is not to
be supposed that all boroughs that made returns were considerable.
Several that are currently said to be decayed, were never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
much better than at present. Some of these were the ancient
demesne of the Crown; the tenants of which not being suitors
to the county courts, nor voting in the election of knights for
the shire, were, still on the same principle of consent to public
burthens, called upon to send their own representatives. Others
received the privilege along with their charter of incorporation,
in the hope that they would thrive more than proved to be
the event; and possibly, even in such early times, the idea of
obtaining influence in the Commons through the votes of their
burgesses might sometimes suggest itself.</p>

<p>That, amidst all this care to secure the positive right of representation,
so little provision should have been made as to its
relative efficiency, that the high-born and opulent gentry should
have been so vastly outnumbered by peddling traders, that the
same number of two should have been deemed sufficient for the
counties of York and Rutland, for Bristol and Gatton, are facts
more easy to wonder at than to explain; for, though the total
ignorance of the government as to the relative population might
be perhaps a sufficient reason for not making an attempt at
equalisation, yet if the representation had been founded on
anything like a numerical principle, there would have been
no difficulty in reducing it to the proportion furnished by the
books of subsidy for each county and borough, or at least in a
rude approximation towards a more rational distribution.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. gave a remarkable proof that no part of the
kingdom, subject to the English laws and parliamentary burthens,
ought to want its representation, by extending the right
of election to the whole of Wales, the counties of Chester and
Monmouth, and even the towns of Berwick and Calais. It
might be possible to trace the reason, why the county of Durham
was passed over. The attachment of those northern parts to
popery seems as likely as any other. Thirty-three were thus
added to the Commons. Edward VI. created fourteen boroughs,
and restored ten that had disused their privilege. Mary added
twenty-one, Elizabeth sixty, and James twenty-seven members.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
</p>

<p>These accessions to the popular chamber of parliament after
the reign of Henry VIII. were by no means derived from a
popular principle, such as had influenced its earlier constitution.
We may account perhaps on this ground for the writs addressed
to a very few towns, such as Westminster. But the design of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that great influx of new members from petty boroughs, which
began in the short reigns of Edward and Mary, and continued
under Elizabeth, must have been to secure the authority of
government, especially in the successive revolutions of religion.
Five towns only in Cornwall made returns at the accession of
Edward VI.; twenty-one at the death of Elizabeth. It will not
be pretended that the wretched villages, which corruption and
perjury still hardly keep from famine, were seats of commerce
and industry in the sixteenth century. But the county of
Cornwall was more immediately subject to a coercive influence,
through the indefinite and oppressive jurisdiction of the stannary
court. Similar motives, if we could discover the secrets of those
governments, doubtless operated in most other cases. A slight
difficulty seems to have been raised in 1563 about the introduction
of representatives from eight new boroughs at once by
charters from the Crown, but was soon waived with the complaisance
usual in those times. Many of the towns, which had
abandoned their privilege at a time when they were compelled
to the payment of daily wages to their members during the
session, were now desirous of recovering it, when that burthen
had ceased and the franchise had become valuable. And the
house, out of favour to popular rights, laid it down in the reign
of James I. as a principle, that every town, which has at any
time returned members to parliament, is entitled to a writ as
a matter of course. The speaker accordingly issued writs to
Hertford, Pomfret, Ilchester, and some other places, on their
petition. The restorations of boroughs in this manner, down
to 1641, are fifteen in number. But though the doctrine that
an elective right cannot be lost by disuse, is still current in
parliament, none of the very numerous boroughs which have
ceased to enjoy that franchise since the days of the three first
Edwards, have from the restoration downwards made any
attempt at retrieving it; nor is it by any means likely that they
would be successful in the application. Charles I., whose temper
inspired him rather with a systematic abhorrence of parliaments
than with any notion of managing them by influence, created
no new boroughs. The right indeed would certainly have been
disputed, however frequently exercised. In 1673 the county
and city of Durham, which had strangely been unrepresented to
so late an æra, were raised by act of parliament to the privileges
of their fellow-subjects.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
 About the same time a charter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
granted to the town of Newark, enabling it to return two
burgesses. It passed with some little objection at the time;
but four years afterwards, after two debates, it was carried on
the question, by 125 to 73, that by virtue of the charter granted
to the town of Newark, it hath right to send burgesses to serve
in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
 Notwithstanding this apparent recognition of
the king's prerogative to summon burgesses from a town not
previously represented, no later instance of its exercise has
occurred; and it would unquestionably have been resisted by
the Commons, not, as is vulgarly supposed, because the act of
union with Scotland has limited the English members to 513
(which is not the case), but upon the broad maxims of exclusive
privilege in matters relating to their own body, which the house
was become powerful enough to assert against the Crown.</p>

<p>It is doubtless a problem of no inconsiderable difficulty to
determine with perfect exactness, by what class of persons the
electoral franchise in ancient boroughs was originally possessed;
yet not perhaps so much so as the carelessness of some, and the
artifices of others, have caused it to appear. The different
opinions on this controverted question may be reduced to the
four following theses:&mdash;1. The original right as enjoyed by
boroughs represented in the parliaments of Edward I., and all
of later creation, where one of a different nature has not been
expressed in the charter from which they derive the privilege,
was in the inhabitant householders resident in the borough, and
paying scot and lot, under those words including local rates,
and probably general taxes. 2. The right sprang from the
tenure of certain freehold lands or burgages within the borough,
and did not belong to any but such tenants. 3. It was derived
from charters of incorporation, and belonged to the community
or freemen of the corporate body. 4. It did not extend to the
generality of freemen, but was limited to the governing part or
municipal magistracy. The actual right of election, as fixed
by determinations of the House of Commons before 1772, and
by committees under the Grenville act since, is variously
grounded upon some of these four principal rules, each of which
has been subject to subordinate modifications which produce
still more complication and irregularity.</p>

<p>Of these propositions, the first was laid down by a celebrated
committee of the House of Commons in 1624, the chairman
whereof was Serjeant Glanville, and the members, as appears by
the list in the journals, the most eminent men, in respect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
legal and constitutional knowledge, that were ever united in
such a body. It is called by them the common-law right, and
that which ought always to obtain, where prescriptive usage
to the contrary cannot be shown. But it has met with very
little favour from the House of Commons since the restoration.
The second has the authority of Lord Holt in the case of Ashby
and White, and of some other lawyers who have turned their
attention to the subject. It countenances what is called the
right of burgage tenure; the electors in boroughs of this description
being such as hold burgages or ancient tenements within
the borough. The next theory, which attaches the primary
franchise to the freemen of corporations, has on the whole been
most received in modern times, if we look either at the decisions
of the proper tribunal, or the current doctrine of lawyers. The
last proposition is that of Dr. Brady, who in a treatise of
boroughs, written to serve the purposes of James II., though
not published till after the revolution, endeavoured to settle
all elective rights on the narrowest and least popular basis.
This work gained some credit, which its perspicuity and acuteness
would deserve, if these were not disgraced by a perverse
sophistry and suppression of truth.</p>

<p>It does not appear at all probable that such varying and
indefinite usages, as we find in our present representation of
boroughs, could have begun simultaneously, when they were
first called to parliament by Edward I. and his two next descendants.
There would have been what may be fairly called
a common-law right, even were we to admit that some variation
from it may, at the very commencement, have occurred in
particular places. The earliest writ of summons directed the
sheriff to make a return from every borough within his jurisdiction,
without any limitation to such as had obtained charters,
or any rule as to the electoral body. Charters, in fact, incorporating
towns seem to have been by no means common in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; and though they grew
more frequent afterwards, yet the first that gave expressly a
right of returning members to parliament was that of Wenlock
under Edward IV. These charters, it has been contended, were
incorporations of the inhabitants, and gave no power either to
exclude any of them or to admit non-resident strangers, according
to the practice of later ages. But, however this may be,
it is highly probable that the word burgess (burgensis), long
before the elective franchise or the character of a corporation
existed, meant literally the free inhabitant householder of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
borough, a member of its court-leet, and subject to its jurisdiction.
We may, I believe, reject with confidence what I have
reckoned as the third proposition; namely, that the elective
franchise belonged, as of common right, to the freemen of
corporations; and still more that of Brady, which few would be
found to support at the present day.</p>

<p>There can, I should conceive, be little pretence for affecting
to doubt that the burgesses of Domesday-book, of the various
early records cited by Madox and others, and of the writs of
summons to Edward's parliament, were inhabitants of tenements
within the borough. But it may remain to be proved
that any were entitled to the privileges or rank of burgesses,
who held less than an estate of freehold in their possessions.
The burgage-tenure, of which we read in Littleton, was evidently
freehold; and it might be doubtful whether the lessees of
dwellings for a term of years, whose interest, in contemplation of
law, is far inferior to a freehold, were looked upon as sufficiently
domiciled within the borough to obtain the appellation of
burgesses. It appears from Domesday that the burgesses, long
before any incorporation, held lands in common belonging to
their town; they had also their guild or market-house, and
were entitled in some places to tolls and customs. These
permanent rights seem naturally restrained to those who
possessed an absolute property in the soil. There can surely be
no question as to mere tenants at will, liable to be removed from
their occupation at the pleasure of the lord; and it is perhaps
unnecessary to mention that the tenancy from year to year, so
usually present, is of very recent introduction. As to estates
for a term of years, even of considerable duration, they were
probably not uncommon in the time of Edward I.; yet far outnumbered,
as I should conceive, by those of a freehold nature.
Whether these lessees were contributory to the ancient local
burthens of scot and lot, as well as to the tallages exacted by the
king, and tenths afterwards imposed by parliament in respect
of movable estate, it seems not easy to determine; but if they
were so, as appears more probable, it was not only consonant
to the principle, that no freeman should be liable to taxation
without the consent of his representatives, to give them a share
in the general privilege of the borough, but it may be inferred
with sufficient evidence from several records, that the privilege
and the burthen were absolutely commensurate; men having
been specially discharged from contributing to tallages, because
they did not participate in the liberties of the borough, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
others being expressly declared subject to those impositions, as
the condition of their being admitted to the rights of burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>

It might however be conjectured that a difference of usage
between those boroughs, where the ancient exclusive rights of
burgage tenants were maintained, and those where the equitable
claim of taxable inhabitants possessing only a chattel interest
received attention, might ultimately produce those very opposite
species of franchise, which we find in the scot and lot borough,
and in those of burgage-tenure. If the franchise, as we now
denominate it, passed in the thirteenth century for a burthen,
subjecting the elector to bear his part in the payment of wages
to the representative, the above conjecture will be equally
applicable, by changing the words right and claim into liability.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
</p>

<p>It was according to the natural course of things, that the
mayors or bailiffs, as returning officers, with some of the principal
burgesses (especially where incorporating charters had given
them a pre-eminence), would take to themselves the advantage
of serving a courtier or neighbouring gentleman, by returning
him to parliament, and virtually exclude the general class of
electors, indifferent to public matters, and without a suspicion
that their individual suffrages could ever be worth purchase.
It is certain that a seat in the Commons was an object of
ambition in the time of Edward IV., and I have little doubt
that it was so in many instances much sooner. But there
existed not the means of that splendid corruption which has
emulated the Crassi and Luculli of Rome. Even so late as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
1571, Thomas Long, a member for Westbury, confessed that he
had given four pounds to the mayor and another person for his
return. The elections were thus generally managed, not often
perhaps by absolute bribery, but through the influence of the
government and of the neighbouring aristocracy; and while
the freemen of the corporation, or resident householders, were
frequently permitted, for the sake of form, to concur in the
election, there were many places where the smaller part of the
municipal body, by whatever names distinguished, acquired a
sort of prescriptive right through an usage, of which it was too
late to show the commencement.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
</p>

<p>It was perceived, however, by the assertors of the popular
cause under James I. that, by this narrowing of the electoral
franchise, many boroughs were subjected to the influence of the
privy council, which, by restoring the householders to their
legitimate rights, would strengthen the interests of the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Hence Lord Coke lays it down in his fourth institute, that "if
the king newly incorporate an ancient borough, which before
sent burgesses to parliament, and granteth that certain selected
burgesses shall make election of the burgesses of parliament,
where all the burgesses elected before, this charter taketh not
away the election of the other burgesses. And so, if a city or
borough hath power to make ordinances, they cannot make
an ordinance that a less number shall elect burgesses for the
parliament than made the election before; for free elections of
members of the high court of parliament are pro bono publico,
and not to be compared to other cases of election of mayors,
bailiffs, etc., of corporations.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
 He adds, however, "by
original grant or by custom, a selected number of burgesses may
elect and bind the residue." This restriction was admitted by
the committee over which Glanville presided in 1624.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
 But
both they and Lord Coke believed the representation of boroughs
to be from a date before what is called legal memory, that is,
the accession of Richard I. It is not easy to reconcile their
principle, that an elective right once subsisting could not be
limited by anything short of immemorial prescription, with
some of their own determinations, and still less with those
which have subsequently occurred, in favour of a restrained right
of suffrage. There seems, on the whole, great reason to be of
opinion, that where a borough is so ancient as to have sent
members to parliament before any charter of incorporation
proved, or reasonably presumed to have been granted, or where
the word burgensis is used without anything to restrain its
meaning in an ancient charter, the right of election ought to have
been acknowledged either in the resident householders paying
general and local taxes, or in such of them as possessed an
estate of freehold within the borough. And whatever may have
been the primary meaning of the word burgess, it appears consonant
to the popular spirit of the English constitution that,
after the possessors of leasehold interests became so numerous
and opulent as to bear a very large share in the public burthens,
they should have enjoyed commensurate privileges; and that
the resolution of Mr. Glanville's committee in favour of what
they called the common-law right should have been far more
uniformly received, and more consistently acted upon, not
merely as agreeable to modern theories of liberty, from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
some have intimated it to have sprung, but as grounded on the
primitive spirit and intention of the law of parliament.</p>

<p>In the reign of Charles II. the House of Commons seems to
have become less favourable to this species of franchise. But
after the revolution, when the struggle of parties was renewed
every three years throughout the kingdom, the right of election
came more continually into question, and was treated with the
grossest partiality by the house, as subordinate to the main
interests of the rival factions. Contrary determinations for the
sole purpose of serving these interests, as each grew in its turn
more powerful, frequently occurred; and at this time the ancient
right of resident householders seems to have grown into disrepute,
and given way to that of corporations, sometimes at
large, sometimes only in a limited and very small number. A
slight check was imposed on this scandalous and systematic
injustice by the act 2 G. ii. c. 2, which renders the last determination
of the House of Commons conclusive as to the right
of election.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
 But this enactment confirmed many decisions
that cannot be reconciled with any sensible rule. The same
iniquity continued to prevail in cases beyond its pale; the fall
of Sir Robert Walpole from power was reckoned to be settled,
when there appeared a small majority against him on the right
of election at Chippenham, a question not very logically connected
with the merits of his administration; and the house
would to this day have gone on trampling on the franchises of
their constituents, if a statute had not been passed through the
authority and eloquence of Mr. Grenville, which has justly been
known by his name. I shall not enumerate the particular
provisions of this excellent law, which, in point of time, does
not fall within the period of my present work; it is generally
acknowledged that, by transferring the judicature in all cases
of controverted elections, from the house to a sworn committee
of fifteen members, the reproach of partiality has been a good
deal lightened, though not perhaps effaced.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="s08">THE REIGN OF JAMES II.</span></h2>

<p>The great question that has been brought forward at the end
of the last chapter, concerning the right and usage of election
in boroughs, was perhaps of less practical importance in the
reign of Charles the Second than we might at first imagine, or
than it might become in the present age. Whoever might be
the legal electors, it is undoubted that a great preponderance
was virtually lodged in the select body of corporations. It was
the knowledge of this that produced the corporation act soon
after the restoration, to exclude the presbyterians, and the more
violent measures of quo warranto at the end of Charles's reign.
If by placing creatures of the court in municipal offices, or by
intimidating the former corporators through apprehensions of
forfeiting their common property and lucrative privileges, what
was called a loyal parliament could be procured, the business of
government, both as to supply and enactment or repeal of laws,
would be carried on far more smoothly, and with less scandal
than by their entire disuse. Few of those who assumed the
name of tories were prepared to sacrifice the ancient fundamental
forms of the constitution. They thought it equally
necessary that a parliament should exist, and that it should have
no will of its own, or none at least, except for the preservation
of that ascendancy of the established religion which even their
loyalty would not consent to surrender.</p>

<p><i>Designs of the king.</i>&mdash;It is not easy to determine whether
James II. had resolved to complete his schemes of arbitrary
government by setting aside even the nominal concurrence of
the two houses of parliament in legislative enactments, and
especially in levying money on his subjects. Lord Halifax had
given him much offence towards the close of the late reign, and
was considered from thenceforth as a man unfit to be employed,
because in the cabinet, on a question whether the people of
New England should be ruled in future by an assembly or by
the absolute pleasure of the Crown, he had spoken very freely
against unlimited monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
 James indeed could hardly avoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
perceiving that the constant acquiescence of an English House
of Commons in the measures proposed to it, a respectful abstinence
from all intermeddling with the administration of affairs,
could never be relied upon or obtained at all, without much of
that dexterous management and influence which he thought it
both unworthy and impolitic to exert. It seems clearly that
he had determined on trying their obedience merely as an
experiment, and by no means to put his authority in any
manner within their control. Hence he took the bold step of
issuing a proclamation for the payment of customs, which by
law expired at the late king's death;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
 and Barillon mentions
several times, that he was resolved to continue in the possession
of the revenue, whether the parliament should grant it or no.
He was equally decided not to accept it for a limited time.
This, as his principal ministers told the ambassador, would be
to establish the necessity of convoking parliament from time to
time, and thus to change the form of government by rendering
the king dependent upon it; rather than which it would be
better to come at once to the extremity of a dissolution,
and maintain the possession of the late king's revenues by
open force.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
 But the extraordinary conduct of this House of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Commons, so unlike any that had met in England for the last
century, rendered any exertion of violence on this score quite
unnecessary.</p>

<p><i>Parliament of 1685.</i>&mdash;The behaviour of that unhonoured
parliament, which held its two short sessions in 1685, though
in a great measure owing to the fickleness of the public mind
and rapid ascendancy of tory principles during the late years,
as well as to a knowledge of the king's severe and vindictive
temper, seems to confirm the assertion strongly made at the
time within its walls, that many of the members had been
unduly returned.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
 The notorious facts indeed, as to the forfeiture
of corporations throughout the kingdom, and their regrant
under such restrictions as might serve the purpose of the
Crown, stand in need of no confirmation. Those who look at
the debates and votes of this assembly, their large grant of a
permanent revenue to the annual amount of two millions,
rendering a frugal prince, in time of peace, entirely out of all
dependence on his people, their timid departure from a resolution
taken to address the king on the only matter for which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>

clause, that any one moving in either house of parliament to

Monmouth's rebellion, for the support of a standing army,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
 will
be inclined to believe that, had James been as zealous for the
church of England as his father, he would have succeeded in
establishing a power so nearly despotic that neither the privileges
of parliament, nor much less those of private men, would
have stood in his way. The prejudice which the two last
Stuarts had acquired in favour of the Roman religion, so often
deplored by thoughtless or insidious writers as one of the worst
consequences of their father's ill fortune, is to be accounted
rather among the most signal links in the chain of causes through
which a gracious Providence has favoured the consolidation of
our liberties and welfare. Nothing less than a motive more
universally operating than the interests of civil freedom would
have stayed the compliant spirit of this unworthy parliament,
or rallied, for a time at least, the supporters of indefinite prerogative
under a banner they abhorred.</p>

<p><i>King's intention to repeal the test act.</i>&mdash;We know that the
king's intention was to obtain the repeal of the habeas corpus
act, a law which he reckoned as destructive of monarchy as the
test was of the catholic religion.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
 And I see no reason to
suppose that he would have failed of this, had he not given
alarm to his high-church parliament, by a premature manifestation
of his design to fill the civil and military employments with
the professors of his own mode of faith.</p>

<p>It has been doubted by Mr. Fox whether James had, in this
part of his reign, conceived the projects commonly imputed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
him, of overthrowing, or injuring by any direct acts of power,
the protestant establishment of this kingdom. Neither the
copious extracts from Barillon's correspondence with his own
court, published by Sir John Dalrymple and himself, nor the
king's own memoirs, seem, in his opinion, to warrant a conclusion
that anything farther was intended than to emancipate
the Roman catholics from the severe restrictions of the penal
laws, securing the public exercise of their worship from molestation,
and to replace them upon an equality as to civil offices,
by abrogating the test act of the late reign.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
 We find nevertheless
a remarkable conversation of the king himself with the
French ambassador, which leaves an impression on the mind
that his projects were already irreconcilable with that pledge of
support he had rather unadvisedly given to the Anglican church
at his accession. This interpretation of his language is confirmed
by the expressions used at the same time by Sunderland,
which are more unequivocal and point at the complete establishment
of the catholic religion.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
 The particular care displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
by James in this conversation, and indeed in so many notorious
instances, to place the army, as far as possible, in the command
of catholic officers, has very much the appearance of his looking
towards the employment of force in overthrowing the protestant
church, as well as the civil privileges of his subjects.
Yet he probably entertained confident hopes, in the outset of
his reign, that he might not be driven to this necessity, or at
least should only have occasion to restrain a fanatical populace.
He would rely on the intrinsic excellence of his own religion,
and still more on the temptations that his favour would hold
out. For the repeal of the test would not have placed the two
religions on a fair level. Catholics, however little qualified,
would have filled, as in fact they did under the dispensing
power, most of the principal stations in the court, law, and
army. The king told Barillon, he was well enough acquainted
with England to be assured, that the admissibility to office
would make more catholics than the right of saying mass
publicly. There was, on the one hand, a prevailing laxity of
principle in the higher ranks, and a corrupt devotedness to
power for the sake of the emoluments it could dispense, which
encouraged the expectation of such a nominal change in religion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
as had happened in the sixteenth century. And, on the other,
much was hoped by the king from the church itself. He had
separated from her communion in consequence of the arguments
which her own divines had furnished; he had conversed with
men bred in the school of Laud; and was slow to believe that
the conclusions which he had, not perhaps unreasonably, derived
from the semi-protestant theology of his father's reign, would
not appear equally irresistible to all minds, when free from the
danger and obloquy that had attended them. Thus by a voluntary
return of the clergy and nation to the bosom of the catholic
church, he might both obtain an immortal renown, and secure
his prerogative against that religious jealousy which had always
been the aliment of political factions.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
 Till this revolution
however could be brought about, he determined to court the
church of England, whose boast of exclusive and unlimited
loyalty could hardly be supposed entirely hollow, in order to
obtain the repeal of the penal laws and disqualifications which
affected that of Rome. And though the maxims of religious
toleration had been always in his mouth, he did not hesitate to
propitiate her with the most acceptable sacrifice, the persecution
of nonconforming ministers. He looked upon the dissenters as
men of republican principles; and if he could have made his
bargain for the free exercise of the catholic worship, I see no
reason to doubt that he would never have announced his general
indulgence to tender consciences.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p><i>James deceived as to the disposition of his subjects.</i>&mdash;But James
had taken too narrow a view of the mighty people whom he
governed. The laity of every class, the tory gentleman almost
equally with the presbyterian artisan, entertained an inveterate
abhorrence of the Romish superstition. Their first education,
the usual tenor of preaching, far more polemical than at present,
the books most current, the tradition of ancient cruelties and
conspiracies, rendered this a cardinal point of religion even with
those who had little beside. Many still gave credit to the
popish plot; and with those who had been compelled to admit
its general falsehood, there remained, as is frequently the case,
an indefinite sense of dislike and suspicion, like the swell of
waves after a storm, which attached itself to all the objects of
that calumny.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
 This was of course enhanced by the insolent
and injudicious confidence of the Romish faction, especially
the priests, in their demeanour, their language, and their publications.
Meanwhile a considerable change had been wrought
in the doctrinal system of the Anglican church since the restoration.
The men most conspicuous in the reign of Charles II. for
their writings, and for their argumentative eloquence in the
pulpit, were of the class who had been denominated Latitudinarian
divines; and while they maintained the principles of the
Remonstrants in opposition to the school of Calvin, were powerful
and unequivocal supporters of the protestant cause against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Rome. They made none of the dangerous concessions which
had shaken the faith of the Duke and Duchess of York, they
regretted the disuse of no superstitious ceremony, they denied
not the one essential characteristic of the reformation, the right
of private judgment, they avoided the mysterious jargon of a
real presence in the Lord's Supper. Thus such an agreement
between the two churches as had been projected at different
times was become far more evidently impracticable, and the
separation more broad and defined.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
 These men, as well as
others who do not properly belong to the same class, were now
distinguished by their courageous and able defences of the
reformation. The victory, in the judgment of the nation, was
wholly theirs. Rome had indeed her proselytes, but such as it
would have been more honourable to have wanted. The people
heard sometimes with indignation, or rather with contempt,
that an unprincipled minister, a temporising bishop, or a licentious
poet, had gone over to the side of a monarch who made
conformity with his religion the only certain path to his favour.</p>

<p><i>Prorogation of parliament.</i>&mdash;The short period of a four years'
reign may be divided by several distinguishing points of time,
which make so many changes in the posture of government.
From the king's accession to the prorogation of parliament on
November 30, 1685, he had acted apparently in concurrence
with the same party that had supported him in his brother's
reign, of which his own seemed the natural and almost undistinguishable
continuation. This party, which had become
incomparably stronger than the opposite, had greeted him with
such unbounded professions,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
 the temper of its representatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
had been such in the first session of parliament, that a prince
less obstinate than James might have expected to succeed in
attaining an authority which the nation seemed to offer. A
rebellion speedily and decisively quelled confirms every government;
it seemed to place his own beyond hazard. Could he
have been induced to change the order of his designs, and
accustom the people to a military force, and to a prerogative
of dispensing with statutes of temporal concern, before he
meddled too ostensibly with their religion, he would possibly
have gained both the objects of his desire. Even conversions
to popery might have been more frequent, if the gross solicitations
of the court had not made them dishonourable. But,
neglecting the hint of a prudent adviser, that the death of
Monmouth left a far more dangerous enemy behind, he suffered
a victory that might have ensured him success, to inspire an
arrogant confidence that led on to destruction. Master of an
army, and determined to keep it on foot, he naturally thought
less of a good understanding with parliament.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
 He had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
rejected the proposition of employing bribery among the members,
an expedient very little congenial to his presumptuous
temper and notions of government.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
 They were assembled, in
his opinion, to testify the nation's loyalty, and thankfulness to
their gracious prince for not taking away their laws and liberties.
But, if a factious spirit of opposition should once prevail, it
could not be his fault if he dismissed them till more becoming
sentiments should again gain ground.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
 Hence, he did not
hesitate to prorogue, and eventually to dissolve, the most compliant
House of Commons that had been returned since his
family had sat on the throne, at the cost of £700,000, a grant of
supply which thus fell to the ground, rather than endure any
opposition on the subject of the test and penal laws. Yet,
from the strength of the court in all divisions, it must seem not
improbable to us that he might, by the usual means of management,
have carried both of those favourite measures, at least
through the lower house of parliament. For the Crown lost the
most important division only by one vote, and had in general
a majority. The very address about unqualified officers, which
gave the king such offence as to bring on a prorogation, was
worded in the most timid manner; the house having rejected
unanimously the words first inserted by their committee, requesting
that his majesty would be pleased not to continue
them in their employments, for a vague petition that "he would
be graciously pleased to give such directions that no apprehensions
or jealousies may remain in the hearts of his majesty's
good and faithful subjects."<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>The second period of this reign extends from the prorogation
of parliament to the dismissal of the Earl of Rochester from the
treasury in 1686. During this time James, exasperated at the
reluctance of the Commons to acquiesce in his measures, and
the decisive opposition of the church, threw off the half restraint
he had imposed on himself; and showed plainly that, with a
bench of judges to pronounce his commands, and an army to
enforce them, he would not suffer the mockery of constitutional
limitations to stand any longer in his way. Two important
steps were made this year towards the accomplishment of his
designs, by the judgment of the court of king's bench in the
case of Sir Edward Hales, confirming the right of the Crown
to dispense with the test act, and by the establishment of the
new ecclesiastical commission.</p>

<p>The kings of England, if not immemorially, yet from a
very early æra in our records, had exercised a prerogative unquestioned
by parliament, and recognised by courts of justice,
that of granting dispensations from the prohibitions and penalties
of particular laws. The language of ancient statutes was
usually brief and careless, with few of those attempts to regulate
prospective contingencies, which, even with our pretended
modern caution, are so often imperfect; and, as the sessions
were never regular, sometimes interrupted for several years,
there was a kind of necessity, or great convenience, in deviating
occasionally from the rigour of a general prohibition; more often
perhaps some motive of interest or partiality would induce the
Crown to infringe on the legal rule. This dispensing power,
however, grew up, as it were, collaterally to the sovereignty of
the legislature, which it sometimes appeared to overshadow.
It was of course asserted in large terms by counsellors of state,
and too frequently by the interpreters of law. Lord Coke,
before he had learned the bolder tone of his declining years, lays
it down, that no act of parliament can bind the king from any
prerogative which is inseparable from his person, so that he may
not dispense with it by a non-obtante; such is his sovereign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
power to command any of his subjects to serve him for the
public weal, which solely and inseparably is annexed to his
person, and cannot be restrained by any act of parliament.
Thus, although the statute 23 H. 6, c. 8, provides that all patents
to hold the office of sheriff for more than one year shall be void,
and even enacts that the king shall not dispense with it; yet it
was held by all the judges in the reign of Henry VII. that the
king may grant such a patent for a longer term on good grounds,
whereof he alone is the judge. So also the statutes which
restrain the king from granting pardons in case of murder have
been held void; and doubtless the constant practice has been
to disregard them.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
</p>

<p>This high and dangerous prerogative, nevertheless, was
subject to several limitations, which none but the grosser
flatterers of monarchy could deny. It was agreed among
lawyers that the king could not dispense with the common law,
nor with any statute prohibiting that which was <i>malum in se</i>,
nor with any right or interest of a private person, or corporation.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>

The rules, however, were still rather complicated, the boundaries
indefinite, and therefore varying according to the political
character of the judges. For many years dispensations had
been confined to taking away such incapacity as either the
statutes of a college, or some law of little consequence, perhaps
almost obsolete, might happen to have created. But when a
collusive action was brought against Sir Edward Hales, a
Roman catholic, in the name of his servant, to recover the
penalty of £500 imposed by the test act, for accepting the commission
of colonel of a regiment, without the previous qualification
of receiving the sacrament in the church of England, the
whole importance of the alleged prerogative became visible, and
the fate of the established constitution seemed to hang upon the
decision. The plaintiff's advocate, Northey, was known to have
received his fee from the other side, and was thence suspected,
perhaps unfairly, of betraying his own cause;<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
 but the chief
justice Herbert showed that no arguments against this prerogative
would have swayed his determination. Not content
with treating the question as one of no difficulty, he grounded
his decision in favour of the defendant upon principles that
would extend far beyond the immediate case. He laid it down
that the kings of England were sovereign princes, that the laws
of England were the king's laws; that it was consequently an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
inseparable prerogative of the Crown to dispense with penal
laws in particular cases, for reasons of which it was the sole
judge. This he called the ancient remains of the sovereign
power and prerogative of the kings of England, which never yet
was taken from them, nor could be. There was no law, he said,
that might not be dispensed with by the supreme lawgiver
(meaning evidently the king, since the proposition would otherwise
be impertinent); though he made a sort of distinction as
to those which affected the subject's private right. But the
general maxims of slavish churchmen and lawyers were asserted
so broadly that a future judge would find little difficulty in
making use of this precedent to justify any stretch of arbitrary
power.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
</p>

<p>It is by no means evident that the decision in this particular
case of Hales, which had the approbation of eleven judges out
of twelve, was against law.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
 The course of former precedents
seems rather to furnish its justification. But the less untenable
such a judgment in favour of the dispensing power might appear,
the more necessity would men of reflection perceive of making
some great change in the relations of the people towards their
sovereign. A prerogative of setting aside the enactments of
parliament, which in trifling matters, and for the sake of conferring
a benefit on individuals, might be suffered to exist with
little mischief, became intolerable when exercised in contravention
of the very principle of those statutes which had been
provided for the security of fundamental liberties or institutions.
Thus the test act, the great achievement, as it had been reckoned,
of the protestant party, for the sake of which the most subservient
of parliaments had just then ventured to lose the king's
favour, became absolutely nugatory and ineffective, by a construction
which the law itself did not reject. Nor was it easy to
provide any sufficient remedy by means of parliament; since it
was the doctrine of the judges, that the king's inseparable and
sovereign prerogatives in matters of government could not be
taken away or restrained by statute. The unadvised assertion
in a court of justice of this principle, which though not by any
means novel, had never been advanced in a business of such
universal concern and interest, may be said to have sealed the
condemnation of the house of Stuart. It made the co-existence
of an hereditary line, claiming a sovereign prerogative paramount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
to the liberties they had vouchsafed to concede, incompatible
with the security or probable duration of those liberties. This
incompatibility is the true basis of the revolution in 1688.</p>

<p>But, whatever pretext the custom of centuries or the authority
of compliant lawyers might afford for these dispensations from
the test, no legal defence could be made for the ecclesiastical
commission of 1686. The high commission court of Elizabeth
had been altogether taken away by an act of the long parliament,
which went on to provide that no new court should be erected
with the like power, jurisdiction, and authority. Yet the commission
issued by James II. followed very nearly the words of
that which had created the original court under Elizabeth,
omitting a few particulars of little moment.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
 It is not known,
I believe, at whose suggestion the king adopted this measure.
The pre-eminence reserved by the commission to Jefferies, whose
presence was made necessary to all their meetings, and the
violence with which he acted in all their transactions on record,
seems to point him out as its great promoter; though it is true
that, at a later period, Jefferies seems to have perceived the
destructive indiscretion of the popish counsellors. It displayed
the king's change of policy and entire separation from that high-church
party, to whom he was indebted for the throne; since
the manifest design of the ecclesiastical commission was to
bridle the clergy, and silence the voice of protestant zeal. The
proceedings against the Bishop of London, and other instances of
hostility to the established religion, are well known.</p>

<p>Elated by success and general submission, exasperated by the
reluctance and dissatisfaction of those on whom he had relied
for an active concurrence with his desires, the king seems at
least by this time to have formed the scheme of subverting, or
impairing as far as possible, the religious establishment. He
told Barillon, alluding to the ecclesiastical commission, that
God had permitted all the statutes which had been enacted
against the catholic religion to become the means of its re-establishment.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>

But the most remarkable evidence of this
design was the collation of Massey, a recent convert, to the
deanery of Christ Church, with a dispensation from all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
statutes of uniformity and other ecclesiastical laws, so ample
that it made a precedent, and such it was doubtless intended to
be, for bestowing any benefices upon members of the church of
Rome. This dispensation seems to have been not generally
known at the time. Burnet has stated the circumstances of
Massey's promotion inaccurately; and no historian, I believe,
till the publication of the instrument after the middle of the last
century, was fully aware of the degree in which the king had
trampled upon the securities of the established church in this
transaction.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Dismissal of Lord Rochester.</i>&mdash;A deeper impression was made
by the dismissal of Rochester from his post of lord treasurer; so
nearly consequent on his positive declaration of adherence to
the protestant religion, after the dispute held in his presence at
the king's particular command, between divines of both persuasions,
that it had much the appearance of a resolution taken
at court to exclude from the high offices of the state all those
who gave no hope of conversion.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
 Clarendon had already given
way to Tyrconnel in the government of Ireland; the privy seal
was bestowed on a catholic peer, Lord Arundel; Lord Bellasis,
of the same religion, was now placed at the head of the commission
of the treasury; Sunderland, though he did not yet
cease to conform, made no secret of his pretended change of
opinion; the council board, by virtue of the dispensing power,
was filled with those who would refuse the test; a small junto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of catholics, with Father Petre, the king's confessor, at their
head, took the management of almost all affairs upon themselves;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>

men, whose known want of principle gave reason to
expect their compliance, were raised to bishoprics; there could
be no rational doubt of a concerted scheme to depress and discountenance
the established church. The dismissal of Rochester,
who had gone great lengths to preserve his power and
emoluments, and would in all probability have concurred in the
establishment of arbitrary power under a protestant sovereign,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>

may be reckoned the most unequivocal evidence of the king's
intentions; and from thence we may date the decisive measures
that were taken to counteract them.</p>

<p><i>Prince of Orange alarmed.</i>&mdash;It was, I do not merely say the
interest, but the clear right and bounden duty, of the Prince
of Orange, to watch over the internal politics of England, on
account of the near connection which his own birth and his
marriage with the presumptive heir had created. He was never
to be reckoned a foreigner as to this country, which, even in
the ordinary course of succession, he might be called to govern.
From the time of his union with the Princess Mary, he was the
legitimate and natural ally of the whig party; alien in all his
sentiments from his two uncles, neither of whom, especially
James, treated him with much regard, on account merely of his
attachment to religion and liberty, for he might have secured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
their affection by falling into their plans. Before such differences
as subsisted between these personages, the bonds of
relationship fall asunder like flax; and William would have
had at least the sanction of many precedents in history, if he
had employed his influence to excite sedition against Charles or
James, and to thwart their administration. Yet his conduct
appears to have been merely defensive; nor had he the remotest
connection with the violent and factious proceedings of Shaftesbury
and his partisans. He played a very dexterous, but
apparently very fair, game throughout the last years of Charles;
never losing sight of the popular party, through whom alone
he could expect influence over England during the life of his
father-in-law, while he avoided any direct rupture with the
brothers, and every reasonable pretext for their taking offence.</p>

<p>It has never been established by any reputable testimony,
though perpetually asserted, nor is it in the least degree probable,
that William took any share in prompting the invasion of
Monmouth.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
 But it is nevertheless manifest that he derived
the greatest advantage from this absurd rebellion and from its
failure; not only, as it removed a mischievous adventurer,
whom the multitude's idle predilection had elevated so high,
that factious men would, under every government, have turned
to account his ambitious imbecility; but as the cruelty with
which this unhappy enterprise was punished rendered the king
odious,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
 while the success of his arms inspired him with false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
confidence, and neglect of caution. Every month, as it brought
forth evidence of James's arbitrary projects, increased the number
of those who looked for deliverance to the Prince of Orange,
either in the course of succession, or by some special interference.
He had, in fact, a stronger motive for watching the councils of
his father-in-law than has generally been known. The king
was, at his accession, in his fifty-fifth year, and had no male
children; nor did the queen's health give much encouragement
to expect them. Every dream of the nation's voluntary return
to the church of Rome must have vanished, even if the consent
of a parliament could be obtained, which was nearly vain to
think of; or if open force and the aid of France should enable
James to subvert the established religion, what had the catholics
to anticipate from his death, but that fearful reaction which had
ensued upon the accession of Elizabeth? This had already so
much disheartened the moderate part of their body that they
were most anxious not to urge forward a change, for which the
kingdom was not ripe, and which was so little likely to endure,
and used their influence to promote a reconciliation between
the king and Prince of Orange, contenting themselves with that
free exercise of their worship which was permitted in Holland.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
But the ambitious priesthood who surrounded the throne had
bolder projects. A scheme was formed early in the king's
reign, to exclude the Princess of Orange from the succession in
favour of her sister Anne, in the event of the latter's conversion
to the Romish faith. The French ministers at our court, Barillon
and Bonrepos, gave ear to this hardy intrigue. They flattered
themselves that both Anne and her husband were favourably
disposed. But in this they were wholly mistaken. No
one could be more unconquerably fixed in her religion than that
princess. The king himself, when the Dutch ambassador, Van
Citers, laid before him a document, probably drawn up by some
catholics of his court, in which these audacious speculations
were developed, declared his indignation at so criminal a project.
It was not even in his power, he let the prince afterwards know
by a message, or in that of parliament, according to the principles
which had been maintained in his own behalf, to change
the fundamental order of succession to the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
 Nothing
indeed can more forcibly paint the desperation of the popish
faction than their entertainment of so preposterous a scheme.
But it naturally increased the solicitude of William about the
intrigues of the English cabinet. It does not appear that any
direct overtures were made to the Prince of Orange, except by
a very few malcontents, till the embassy of Dykvelt from the
States in the spring of 1687. It was William's object to ascertain,
through that minister, the real state of parties in England.
Such assurances as he carried back to Holland gave encouragement
to an enterprise that would have been equally injudicious
and unwarrantable without them.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
 Danby, Halifax, Nottingham,
and others of the tory, as well as whig factions, entered
into a secret correspondence with the Prince of Orange; some
from a real attachment to the constitutional limitations of
monarchy; some from a conviction that, without open apostasy
from the protestant faith, they could never obtain from James
the prizes of their ambition. This must have been the predominant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
motive with Lord Churchill, who never gave any
proof of solicitude about civil liberty; and his influence taught
the Princess Anne to distinguish her interest from those of her
father. It was about this time also that even Sunderland
entered upon a mysterious communication with the Prince of
Orange; but whether he afterwards served his present master
only to betray him, as has been generally believed, or sought
rather to propitiate, by clandestine professions, one who might
in the course of events become such, is not perhaps what the
evidence already known to the world will enable us to determine.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>

The apologists of James have often represented Sunderland's
treachery as extending back to the commencement of this
reign, as if he had entered upon the king's service with no other
aim than to put him on measures that would naturally lead to
his ruin. But the simpler hypothesis is probably nearer the
truth: a corrupt and artful statesman could have no better
prospect for his own advantage than the power and popularity
of a government which he administered; it was a conviction of
the king's incorrigible and infatuated adherence to designs which
the rising spirit of the nation rendered utterly infeasible, an
apprehension that, whenever a free parliament should be called,
he might experience the fate of Strafford as an expiation for the
sins of the Crown, which determined him to secure as far as
possible his own indemnity upon a revolution that he could not
have withstood.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>The dismissal of Rochester was followed up at no great distance
of time, by the famous declaration for liberty of conscience,
suspending the execution of all penal laws concerning religion,
and freely pardoning all offences against them, in as full a
manner as if each individual had been named. He declared
also his will and pleasure that the oaths of supremacy and
allegiance, and the several tests enjoined by statutes of the late
reign, should no longer be required of any one before his admission
to offices of trust. The motive of this declaration was not
so much to relieve the Roman catholics from penal and incapacitating
statutes (which, since the king's accession and the judgment
of the court of king's bench in favour of Hales, were
virtually at an end), as by extending to the protestant dissenters
the same full measure of toleration, to enlist under the
standard of arbitrary power those who had been its most
intrepid and steadiest adversaries. It was after the prorogation
of parliament that he had begun to caress that party, who
in the first months of his reign had endured a continuance of
their persecution.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
 But the clergy in general detested the nonconformists
still more than the papists, and had always abhorred
the idea of even a parliamentary toleration. The present
declaration went much farther than the recognised prerogative
of dispensing with prohibitory statutes. Instead of removing
the disability from individuals by letters patent, it swept away
at once, in effect, the solemn ordinances of the legislature.
There was, indeed, a reference to the future concurrence of the
two houses, whenever he should think it convenient for them to
meet; but so expressed as rather to insult, than pay respect
to, their authority.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
 And no one could help considering the
declaration of a similar nature just published in Scotland, as
the best commentary on the present. In that he suspended all
laws against the Roman catholics and moderate presbyterians,
"by his sovereign authority, prerogative royal, and absolute
power, which all his subjects were to obey without reserve;"
and its whole tenor spoke, in as unequivocal language as his
grandfather was accustomed to use, his contempt of all pretended
limitations on his will.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
 Though the constitution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Scotland was not so well balanced as our own, it was notorious
that the Crown did not legally possess an absolute power in
that kingdom; and men might conclude that, when he should
think it less necessary to observe some measures with his
English subjects, he would address them in the same strain.</p>

<p>Those, indeed, who knew by what course his favour was to be
sought, did not hesitate to go before, and light him, as it were,
to the altar on which their country's liberty was to be the
victim. Many of the addresses which fill the columns of the
<i>London Gazette</i> in 1687, on occasion of the declaration of indulgence,
flatter the king with assertions of his dispensing power.
The benchers and barristers of the Middle Temple, under the
direction of the prostitute Shower, were again foremost in the
race of infamy. They thank him "for asserting his own royal
prerogatives, the very life of the law, and of their profession;
which prerogatives, as they were given by God himself, so no
power upon earth could diminish them, but they must always
remain entire and inseparable from his royal person; which
prerogatives as the addressers had studied to know, so they
were resolved to defend, by asserting with their lives and
fortunes that divine maxim, <i>à Deo rex, à lege rex</i>."<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
</p>

<p>These addresses, which, to the number of some hundreds,
were sent up from every description of persons, the clergy, the
nonconformists of all denominations, the grand juries, the
justices of the peace, the corporations, the inhabitants of towns,
in consequence of the declaration, afford a singular contrast to
what we know of the prevailing dispositions of the people in
that year, and of their general abandonment of the king's cause
before the end of the next. Those from the clergy, indeed,
disclose their ill-humour at the unconstitutional indulgence,
limiting their thanks to some promises of favour the king had
used towards the established church. But as to the rest, we
should have cause to blush for the servile hypocrisy of our
ancestors, if there were not good reason to believe that these
addresses were sometimes the work of a small minority in the
name of the rest, and that the grand juries and the magistracy
in general had been so garbled for the king's purposes in this
year that they formed a very inadequate representation of that
great class from which they ought to have been taken.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
 It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
however very natural that they should deceive the court. The
catholics were eager for that security which nothing but an act
of the legislature could afford; and James, who, as well as his
minister, had a strong aversion to the measure, seems about the
latter end of the summer of 1687 to have made a sudden change
in his scheme of government, and resolved once more to try the
disposition of a parliament. For this purpose, having dissolved
that from which he could expect nothing hostile to the church,
he set himself to manage the election of another in such a manner
as to ensure his main object, the security of the Romish religion.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
</p>

<p>"His first care," says his biographer Innes, "was to purge
the corporations from that leaven which was in danger of corrupting
the whole kingdom; so he appointed certain regulators
to inspect the conduct of several borough towns, to correct
abuses where it was practicable, and where not, by forfeiting
their charters, to turn out such rotten members as infected the
rest. But in this, as in most other cases, the king had the
fortune to choose persons not too well qualified for such an
employment, and extremely disagreeable to the people; it was
a sort of motley council made up of catholics and presbyterians,
a composition which was sure never to hold long together, or
that could probably unite in any method suitable to both their
interests; it served therefore only to increase the public odium
by their too arbitrary ways of turning out and putting in; and
yet those who were thus intruded, as it were, by force, being of the
presbyterian party, were by this time become as little inclinable
to favour the king's intentions as the excluded members."<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>This endeavour to violate the legal rights of electors as well
as to take away other vested franchises, by new modelling
corporations through commissions granted to regulators, was
the most capital delinquency of the king's government; because
it tended to preclude any reparation for the rest, and directly
attacked the fundamental constitution of the state.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
 But,
like all his other measures, it displayed not more ill-will to
the liberties of the nation than inability to overthrow them.
The catholics were so small a body, and so weak, especially
in corporate towns, that the whole effect produced by the regulators
was to place municipal power and trust in the hands of
the nonconformists, those precarious and unfaithful allies of the
court, whose resentment of past oppression, hereditary attachment
to popular principles of government, and inveterate
abhorrence of popery, were not to be effaced by an unnatural
coalition. Hence, though they availed themselves, and surely
without reproach, of the toleration held out to them, and even
took the benefit of the scheme of regulation, so as to fill the
corporation of London and many others, they were, as is confessed
above, too much of Englishmen and protestants for the
purposes of the court. The wiser part of the churchmen made
secret overtures to their party; and by assurances of a toleration,
if not also of a comprehension within the Anglican pale,
won them over to a hearty concurrence in the great project
that was on foot.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
 The king found it necessary to descend so
much from the haughty attitude he had taken at the outset of
his reign, as personally to solicit men of rank and local influence
for their votes on the two great measures of repealing the test
and penal laws. The country gentlemen, in their different
counties, were tried with circular questions, whether they
would comply with the king in their elections, or, if themselves
chosen, in parliament. Those who refused such a promise were
erased from the lists of justices and deputy-lieutenants.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
 Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
his biographer admits that he received little encouragement to
proceed in the experiment of a parliament;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
 and it is said by
the French ambassador that evasive answers were returned to
these questions, with such uniformity of expression as indicated
an alarming degree of concert.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Affair of Magdalen College.</i>&mdash;It is unnecessary to dwell on
circumstances so well known as the expulsion of the fellows of
Magdalen College.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
 It was less extensively mischievous than
the new-modelling of corporations, but perhaps a more glaring
act of despotism. For though the Crown had been accustomed
from the time of the reformation to send very peremptory
commands to ecclesiastical foundations, and even to dispense
with their statutes at discretion, with so little resistance that
few seemed to doubt of its prerogative; though Elizabeth
would probably have treated the fellows of any college much in
the same manner as James II., if they had proceeded to an
election in defiance of her recommendation; yet the right was
not the less clearly theirs, and the struggles of a century would
have been thrown away, if James II. was to govern as the
Tudors, or even as his father and grandfather had done before
him. And though Parker, Bishop of Oxford, the first president
whom the ecclesiastical commissioners obtruded on the college,
was still nominally a protestant,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
 his successor Gifford was an
avowed member of the church of Rome. The college was filled
with persons of the same persuasion; mass was said in the
chapel, and the established religion was excluded with a degree
of open force which entirely took away all security for its preservation
in any other place. This latter act, especially, of the
Magdalen drama, in a still greater degree than the nomination
of Massey to the deanery of Christ Church, seems a decisive
proof that the king's repeated promises of contenting himself with
a toleration of his own religion would have yielded to his insuperable
bigotry and the zeal of his confessor. We may perhaps
add to these encroachments upon the act of uniformity, the
design imputed to him of conferring the archbishopric of York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
on Father Petre; yet there would have been difficulties that
seem insurmountable in the way of this, since the validity of
Anglican orders not being acknowledged by the church of Rome,
Petre would not have sought consecration at the hands of
Sancroft; nor, had he done so, would the latter have conferred
it on him, even if the chapter of York had gone through the
indispensable form of an election.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
</p>

<p>The infatuated monarch was irritated by that which he
should have taken as a terrible warning, this resistance to his
will from the university of Oxford. That sanctuary of pure
unspotted loyalty, as some would say, that sink of all that was
most abject in servility, as less courtly tongues might murmur,
the university of Oxford, which had but four short years back,
by a solemn decree in convocation, poured forth anathemas on
all who had doubted the divine right of monarchy, or asserted
the privileges of subjects against their sovereigns, which had
boasted in its addresses of an obedience without any restrictions
or limitations, which but recently had seen a known convert
to popery, and a person disqualified in other ways, installed by
the chapter without any remonstrance in the deanery of Christ
Church, was now the scene of a firm though temperate opposition
to the king's positive command, and soon after the willing
instrument of his ruin. In vain the pamphleteers, on the side
of the court, upbraided the clergy with their apostacy from the
principles they had so much vaunted. The imputation it was
hard to repel; but, if they could not retract their course without
shame, they could not continue in it without destruction.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>

They were driven to extremity by the order of May 4, 1688, to
read the declaration of indulgence in their churches.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
 This, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
is well known, met with great resistance, and, by inducing the
primate and six other bishops to present a petition to the king
against it, brought on that famous persecution, which, more
perhaps than all his former actions, cost him the allegiance of
the Anglican church. The proceedings upon the trial of those
prelates are so familiar as to require no particular notice.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>

What is most worthy of remark is, that the very party who had
most extolled the royal prerogative, and often in such terms as
if all limitations of it were only to subsist at pleasure, became
now the instruments of bringing it down within the compass and
control of the law. If the king had a right to suspend the
execution of statutes by proclamation, the bishops' petition
might not indeed be libellous, but their disobedience and that
of the clergy could not be warranted; and the principal argument
both of the bar and the bench rested on the great question of
that prerogative.</p>

<p>The king, meantime, was blindly hurrying on at the instigation
of his own pride and bigotry, and of some ignorant priests,
confident in the fancied obedience of the church, and in the
hollow support of the dissenters; after all his wiser counsellors,
the catholic peers, the nuncio, perhaps the queen herself, had
grown sensible of the danger, and solicitous for temporising
measures. He had good reason to perceive that neither the
fleet nor the army could be relied upon; to cashier the most
rigidly protestant officers, to draft Irish troops into the
regiments, to place all important commands in the hands of
catholics, were difficult and even desperate measures, which
rendered his designs more notorious, without rendering them
more feasible. It is among the most astonishing parts of this
unhappy sovereign's impolicy, that he sometimes neglected,
even offended, never steadily and sufficiently courted, the sole
ally that could by possibility have co-operated in his scheme of
government. In his brother's reign, James had been the most
obsequious and unhesitating servant of the French king. Before
his own accession, his first step was to implore, through Barillon,
a continuance of that support and protection, without which he
could undertake nothing which he had designed in favour of the
catholics. He received a present of 500,000 livres with tears of
gratitude; and telling the ambassador he had not disclosed his
real designs to his ministers, pressed for a strict alliance with
Louis, as the means of accomplishing them.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
 Yet with a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
inconsistency, he drew off gradually from these professions,
and not only kept on rather cool terms with France during part
of his reign, but sometimes played a double game by treating of
a league with Spain.</p>

<p><i>James's coldness towards Louis.</i>&mdash;The secret of this uncertain
policy, which has not been well known till very lately, is to be
found in the king's character. James had a real sense of the
dignity pertaining to a king of England, and much of the
national pride as well as that of his rank. He felt the degradation
of importuning an equal sovereign for money, which Louis gave
less frequently and in smaller measure than it was demanded.
It is natural for a proud man not to love those before whom he
has abased himself. James, of frugal habits and master of a
great revenue, soon became more indifferent to a French pension.
Nor was he insensible to the reproach of Europe, that he was
grown the vassal of France and had tarnished the lustre of the
English Crown.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
 Had he been himself protestant, or his
subjects catholic, he would probably have given the reins to
that jealousy of his ambitious neighbour, which, even in his
peculiar circumstances, restrained him from the most expedient
course; I mean expedient, on the hypothesis that to overthrow
the civil and religious institutions of his people was to be the
main object of his reign. For it was idle to attempt this without
the steady co-operation of France; and those sentiments of
dignity and independence, which at first sight appear to do him
honour, being without any consistent magnanimity of character,
served only to accelerate his ruin, and confirm the persuasion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
his incapacity.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
 Even in the memorable year 1688, though the
veil was at length torn from his eyes on the verge of the precipice,
and he sought in trembling the assistance he had slighted, his
silly pride made him half unwilling to be rescued; and, when the
French ambassador at the Hague, by a bold man&oelig;uvre of
diplomacy, asserted to the States that an alliance already subsisted
between his master and the king of England, the latter
took offence at the unauthorised declaration, and complained
privately that Louis treated him as an inferior.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
 It is probable
that a more ingenuous policy in the court of Whitehall, by
determining the king of France to declare war sooner on Holland,
would have prevented the expedition of the Prince of Orange.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
</p>

<p>The latter continued to receive strong assurances of attachment
from men of rank in England; but wanted that direct
invitation to enter the kingdom with force, which he required
both for his security and his justification. No men who thought
much about their country's interests or their own would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
hasty in venturing on so awful an enterprise. The punishment
and ignominy of treason, the reproach of history, too often the
sworn slave of fortune, awaited its failure. Thus Halifax and
Nottingham found their conscience or their courage unequal to
the crisis, and drew back from the hardy conspiracy that produced
the revolution.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
 Nor, perhaps, would the seven eminent
persons, whose names are subscribed to the invitation addressed
on the 30th of June 1688, to the Prince of Orange, the Earls of
Danby, Shrewsbury, and Devonshire, Lords Delamere and
Lumley, the Bishop of London, and Admiral Russell, have committed
themselves so far, if the recent birth of a Prince of Wales
had not made some measures of force absolutely necessary for
the common interests of the nation and the Prince of Orange.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>

It cannot be said without absurdity, that James was guilty of
any offence in becoming father of this child; yet it was evidently
that which rendered his other offence inexpiable. He was now
considerably advanced in life; and the decided resistance of his
subjects made it improbable that he could do much essential
injury to the established constitution during the remainder of
it. The mere certainty of all reverting to a protestant heir
would be an effectual guarantee of the Anglican church. But the
birth of a son to be nursed in the obnoxious bigotry of Rome,
the prospect of a regency under the queen, so deeply implicated,
according to common report, in the schemes of this reign, made
every danger appear more terrible. From the moment that the
queen's pregnancy was announced, the catholics gave way to
enthusiastic unrepressed exultation; and by the confidence
with which they prophesied the birth of an heir, furnished a
pretext for the suspicions which a disappointed people began to
entertain.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
 These suspicions were very general; they extended
to the highest ranks, and are a conspicuous instance of that
prejudice which is chiefly founded on our wishes. Lord Danby,
in a letter to William, of March 27, insinuates his doubt of the
queen's pregnancy. After the child's birth, the seven subscribers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to the association inviting the prince to come over, and
pledging themselves to join him, say that not one in a thousand
believe it to be the queen's; Lord Devonshire separately held
language to the same effect.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
 The Princess Anne talked with
little restraint of her suspicions, and made no scruple of imparting
them to her sister.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
 Though no one can hesitate at
present to acknowledge that the Prince of Wales's legitimacy
is out of all question, there was enough to raise a reasonable
apprehension in the presumptive heir, that a party not really
very scrupulous, and through religious animosity supposed to
be still less so, had been induced by the undoubted prospect of
advantage to draw the king, who had been wholly their slave,
into one of those frauds which bigotry might call pious.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Justice and necessity of the Revolution.</i>&mdash;The great event however
of what has been emphatically denominated in the language
of our public acts the Glorious Revolution stands in need of no
vulgar credulity, no mistaken prejudice, for its support. It can
only rest on the basis of a liberal theory of government, which
looks to the public good as the great end for which positive laws
and the constitutional order of states have been instituted. It
cannot be defended without rejecting the slavish principles of
absolute obedience, or even that pretended modification of them
which imagines some extreme cases of intolerable tyranny,
some, as it were, lunacy of despotism, as the only plea and
palliation of resistance. Doubtless the administration of James
II. was not of this nature. Doubtless he was not a Caligula, or
a Commodus, or an Ezzelin, or a Galeazzo Sforza, or a Christiern
II. of Denmark, or a Charles IX. of France, or one of those
almost innumerable tyrants whom men have endured in the
wantonness of unlimited power. No man had been deprived
of his liberty by any illegal warrant. No man, except in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
single though very important instance of Magdalen College,
had been despoiled of his property. I must also add that the
government of James II. will lose little by comparison with that
of his father. The judgment in favour of his prerogative to
dispense with the test, was far more according to received notions
of law, far less injurious and unconstitutional, than that which
gave a sanction to ship-money. The injunction to read the
declaration of indulgence in churches was less offensive to
scrupulous men than the similar command to read the declaration
of Sunday sports in the time of Charles I. Nor was any
one punished for a refusal to comply with the one; while the
prisons had been filled with those who had disobeyed the other.
Nay, what is more, there are much stronger presumptions of the
father's than of the son's intention to lay aside parliaments,
and set up an avowed despotism. It is indeed amusing to
observe that many, who scarcely put bounds to their eulogies
of Charles I., have been content to abandon the cause of one
who had no faults in his public conduct but such as seemed to
have come by inheritance. The characters of the father and
son were very closely similar: both proud of their judgment as
well as their station, and still more obstinate in their understanding
than in their purpose; both scrupulously conscientious
in certain great points of conduct, to the sacrifice of that power
which they had preferred to everything else; the one far superior
in relish for the arts and for polite letters, the other more
diligent and indefatigable in business; the father exempt from
those vices of a court to which the son was too long addicted;
not so harsh perhaps or prone to severity in his temper, but
inferior in general sincerity and adherence to his word. They
were both equally unfitted for the condition in which they were
meant to stand&mdash;the limited kings of a wise and free people,
the chiefs of the English commonwealth.</p>

<p>The most plausible argument against the necessity of so violent
a remedy for public grievances as the abjuration of allegiance to
a reigning sovereign, was one that misled half the nation in that
age, and is still sometimes insinuated by those whose pity for
the misfortunes of the house of Stuart appears to predominate
over every other sentiment which the history of the revolution
should excite. It was alleged that the constitutional mode of
redress by parliament was not taken away; that the king's
attempts to obtain promises of support from the electors and
probable representatives showed his intention of calling one;
that the writs were in fact ordered before the Prince of Orange's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
expedition; that after the invader had reached London, James
still offered to refer the terms of reconciliation with his people
to a free parliament, though he could have no hope of evading
any that might be proposed; that by reversing illegal judgments,
by annulling unconstitutional dispensations, by reinstating
those who had been unjustly dispossessed, by punishing
wicked advisers, above all, by passing statutes to restrain the
excesses and cut off the dangerous prerogatives of the monarchy
(as efficacious, or more so, than the bill of rights and other
measures that followed the revolution), all risk of arbitrary
power, or of injury to the established religion, might have been
prevented without a violation of that hereditary right which
was as fundamental in the constitution as any of the subject's
privileges. It was not necessary to enter upon the delicate
problem of absolute non-resistance, or to deny that the conservation
of the whole was paramount to all positive laws. The
question to be proved was, that a regard to this general safety
exacted the means employed in the revolution, and constituted
that extremity which could alone justify such a deviation from
the standard rules of law and religion.</p>

<p>It is evidently true that James had made very little progress,
or rather experienced a signal defeat, in his endeavour to place
the professors of his own religion on a firm and honourable
basis. There seems the strongest reason to believe that far
from reaching his end through the new parliament, he would
have experienced those warm assaults on the administration,
which generally distinguished the House of Commons under his
father and brother. But, as he was in no want of money, and
had not the temper to endure what he thought the language of
republican faction, we may be equally sure that a short and
angry session would have ended with a more decided resolution
on his side to govern in future without such impracticable
counsellors. The doctrine imputed of old to Lord Strafford,
that, after trying the good-will of parliament in vain, a king
was absolved from the legal maxims of government, was always
at the heart of the Stuarts. His army was numerous, according
at least to English notions; he had already begun to fill it with
popish officers and soldiers; the militia, though less to be
depended on, was under the command of lord and deputy
lieutenants carefully selected; above all, he would at the last
have recourse to France; and though the experiment of bringing
over French troops was very hazardous, it is difficult to say
that he might not have succeeded, with all these means, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
preventing or putting down any concerted insurrection. But at
least the renewal of civil bloodshed and the anarchy of rebellion
seemed to be the alternative of slavery, if William had never
earned the just title of our deliverer. It is still more evident
that, after the invasion had taken place, and a general defection
had exhibited the king's inability to resist, there could have
been no such compromise as the Tories fondly expected, no
legal and peaceable settlement in what they called a free parliament,
leaving James in the real and recognised possession
of his constitutional prerogatives. Those who have grudged
William III. the laurels that he won for our service are ever
prone to insinuate, that his unnatural ambition would be content
with nothing less than the Crown, instead of returning to his
country after he had convinced the king of the error of his
counsels, and obtained securities for the religion and liberties of
England. The hazard of the enterprise, and most hazardous it
truly was, was to have been his; the profit and advantage our
own. I do not know that William absolutely expected to place
himself on the throne; because he could hardly anticipate
that James would so precipitately abandon a kingdom wherein
he was acknowledged, and had still many adherents. But undoubtedly
he must, in consistency with his magnanimous designs,
have determined to place England in its natural station, as a
party in the great alliance against the power of Louis XIV. To
this one object of securing the liberties of Europe, and chiefly
of his own country, the whole of his heroic life was directed
with undeviating, undisheartened firmness. He had in view no
distant prospect, when the entire succession of the Spanish
monarchy would be claimed by that insatiable prince, whose
renunciation at the treaty of the Pyrenees was already maintained
to be invalid. Against the present aggressions and
future schemes of this neighbour the league of Augsburg had
just been concluded. England, a free, a protestant, a maritime
kingdom, would, in her natural position, as a rival of France,
and deeply concerned in the independence of the Netherlands,
become a leading member of this confederacy. But the sinister
attachments of the house of Stuarts had long diverted her from
her true interests, and rendered her councils disgracefully and
treacherously subservient to those of Louis. It was therefore
the main object of the Prince of Orange to strengthen the alliance
by the vigorous co-operation of this kingdom; and with
no other view, the emperor, and even the pope, had abetted his
undertaking. But it was impossible to imagine that James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
would have come with sincerity into measures so repugnant to
his predilections and interests. What better could be expected
than a recurrence of that false and hollow system which had
betrayed Europe and dishonoured England under Charles II.;
or rather, would not the sense of injury and thraldom have
inspired still more deadly aversion to the cause of those to
whom he must have ascribed his humiliation? There was as
little reason to hope that he would abandon the long-cherished
schemes of arbitrary power, and the sacred interests of his own
faith. We must remember that, when the adherents or apologists
of James II. have spoken of him as an unfortunately misguided
prince, they have insinuated what neither the notorious
history of those times, nor the more secret information since
brought to light, will in any degree confirm. It was indeed a
strange excuse for a king of such mature years, and so trained
in the most diligent attention to business. That in some particular
instances he acted under the influence of his confessor,
Petre, is not unlikely; but the general temper of his administration,
his notions of government, the objects he had in view,
were perfectly his own, and were pursued rather in spite of much
dissuasion and many warnings, than through the suggestions of
any treacherous counsellors.</p>

<p>Both with respect therefore to the Prince of Orange and to
the English nation, James II. was to be considered as an enemy
whose resentment could never be appeased, and whose power
consequently must be wholly taken away. It is true that, if he
had remained in England, it would have been extremely difficult
to deprive him of the nominal sovereignty. But in this case,
the Prince of Orange must have been invested, by some course
or other, with all its real attributes. He undoubtedly intended
to remain in this country; and could not otherwise have preserved
that entire ascendancy which was necessary for his
ultimate purposes. The king could not have been permitted,
with any common prudence, to retain the choice of his ministers,
or the command of his army, or his negative voice in laws, or
even his personal liberty; by which I mean, that his guards
must have been either Dutch, or at least appointed by the prince
and parliament. Less than this it would have been childish to
require; and this would not have been endured by any man
even of James's spirit, or by the nation, when the re-action of
loyalty should return, without continued efforts to get rid of
an arrangement far more revolutionary and subversive of the
established monarchy than the king's deposition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p><i>Favourable circumstances attending the revolution.</i>&mdash;In the
revolution of 1688 there was an unusual combination of favouring
circumstances, and some of the most important, such as
the king's sudden flight, not within prior calculation, which
render it no precedent for other times and occasions in point of
expediency, whatever it may be in point of justice. Resistance
to tyranny by overt rebellion incurs not only the risks of failure,
but those of national impoverishment and confusion, of vindictive
retaliation, and such aggressions (perhaps inevitable) on private
right and liberty as render the name of revolution and its
adherents odious. Those, on the other hand, who call in a
powerful neighbour to protect them from domestic oppression,
may too often expect to realise the horse of the fable, and endure
a subjection more severe, permanent, and ignominious, than
what they shake off. But the revolution effected by William III.
united the independent character of a national act with the
regularity and the coercion of anarchy which belong to a military
invasion. The United Provinces were not such a foreign
potentate as could put in jeopardy the independence of England;
nor could his army have maintained itself against the inclinations
of the kingdom, though it was sufficient to repress any turbulence
that would naturally attend so extraordinary a crisis. Nothing
was done by the multitude; no new men, soldiers, or demagogues,
had their talents brought forward by this rapid and
pacific revolution; it cost no blood, it violated no right, it was
hardly to be traced in the course of justice; the formal and
exterior character of the monarchy remained nearly the same
in so complete a regeneration of its spirit. Few nations can
hope to ascend up to the sphere of a just and honourable liberty,
especially when long use has made the track of obedience
familiar, and they have learned to move as it were only by the
clank of the chain, with so little toil and hardship. We reason
too exclusively from this peculiar instance of 1688, when we hail
the fearful struggles of other revolutions with a sanguine and
confident sympathy. Nor is the only error upon this side.
For, as if the inveterate and cankerous ills of a commonwealth
could be extirpated with no loss and suffering, we are often
prone to abandon the popular cause in agitated nations with
as much fickleness as we embraced it, when we find that
intemperance, irregularity, and confusion, from which great
revolutions are very seldom exempt. These are indeed so much
their usual attendants, the re-action of a self-deceived multitude
is so probable a consequence, the general prospect of success in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
most cases so precarious, that wise and good men are more likely
to hesitate too long, than to rush forward too eagerly. Yet,
"whatever be the cost of this noble liberty, we must be content
to pay it to Heaven."<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
</p>

<p>It is unnecessary even to mention those circumstances of
this great event, which are minutely known to almost all my
readers. They were all eminently favourable in their effect to
the regeneration of our constitution; even one of temporary
inconvenience, namely, the return of James to London, after
his detention by the fishermen near Feversham. This, as Burnet
has observed, and as is easily demonstrated by the writings of
that time, gave a different colour to the state of affairs, and
raised up a party which did not before exist, or at least was too
disheartened to show itself.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
 His first desertion of the kingdom
had disgusted every one, and might be construed into a voluntary
cession. But his return to assume again the government
put William under the necessity of using that intimidation
which awakened the mistaken sympathy of a generous people.
It made his subsequent flight, though certainly not what a man
of courage enough to give his better judgment free play would
have chosen, appear excusable and defensive. It brought out
too glaringly, I mean for the satisfaction of prejudiced minds,
the undeniable fact, that the two houses of convention deposed
and expelled their sovereign. Thus the great schism of the
Jacobites, though it must otherwise have existed, gained its
chief strength; and the revolution, to which at the outset a
coalition of whigs and tories had conspired, became in its final
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
result, in the settlement of the Crown upon William and Mary,
almost entirely the work of the former party.</p>

<p>But while the position of the new government was thus
rendered less secure, by narrowing the basis of public opinion
whereon it stood, the liberal principles of policy which the whigs
had espoused became incomparably more powerful, and were
necessarily involved in the continuance of the revolution settlement.
The ministers of William III. and of the house of
Brunswick had no choice but to respect and countenance the
doctrines of Locke, Hoadley, and Molesworth. The assertion
of passive obedience to the Crown grew obnoxious to the Crown
itself. Our new line of sovereigns scarcely ventured to hear
of their hereditary right, and dreaded the cup of flattery that
was drugged with poison. This was the greatest change that
affected our monarchy by the fall of the house of Stuart. The
laws were not so materially altered as the spirit and sentiments
of the people. Hence those who look only at the former have
been prone to underrate the magnitude of this revolution. The
fundamental maxims of the constitution, both as they regard
the king and the subject, may seem nearly the same; but the
disposition with which they were received and interpreted was
entirely different.</p>

<p><i>Its salutary consequences.</i>&mdash;It was in this turn of feeling, in
this change, if I may so say, of the heart, far more than in any
positive statutes and improvements of the law, that I consider
the revolution to have been eminently conducive to our freedom
and prosperity. Laws and statutes as remedial, nay more
closely limiting the prerogative than the bill of rights and act
of settlement, might possibly have been obtained from James
himself, as the price of his continuance on the throne, or from
his family as that of their restoration to it. But what the
revolution did for us was this; it broke the spell that had
charmed the nation. It cut up by the roots all that theory
of indefeasible right, of paramount prerogative, which had
put the Crown in continual opposition to the people. A contention
had now subsisted for five hundred years, but particularly
during the four last reigns, against the aggressions of
arbitrary power. The sovereigns of this country had never
patiently endured the control of parliament; nor was it natural
for them to do so, while the two houses of parliament appeared
historically, and in legal language, to derive their existence as
well as privileges from the Crown itself. They had at their side
the pliant lawyers, who held the prerogative to be uncontrollable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
by statutes, a doctrine of itself destructive to any scheme of
reconciliation and compromise between a king and his subjects;
they had the churchmen, whose casuistry denied that the most
intolerable tyranny could excuse resistance to a lawful government.
These two propositions could not obtain general acceptation
without rendering all national liberty precarious.</p>

<p>It has been always reckoned among the most difficult problems
in the practical science of government, to combine an hereditary
monarchy with security of freedom, so that neither the ambition
of kings shall undermine the people's rights, nor the jealousy
of the people overturn the throne. England had already experience
of both these mischiefs. And there seemed no prospect
before her, but either their alternate recurrence, or a final submission
to absolute power, unless by one great effort she could
put the monarchy for ever beneath the law, and reduce it to an
integrant portion instead of the primary source and principle
of the constitution. She must reverse the favoured maxim,
"A Deo rex, à rege lex;" and make the Crown itself appear the
creature of the law. But our ancient monarchy, strong in a
possession of seven centuries, and in those high and paramount
prerogatives which the consenting testimony of lawyers and the
submission of parliaments had recognised, a monarchy from
which the House of Commons and every existing peer, though
not perhaps the aristocratic order itself, derived its participation
in the legislature, could not be bent to the republican theories
which have been not very successfully attempted in some
modern codes of constitution. It could not be held, without
breaking up all the foundations of our polity, that the monarchy
emanated from the parliament, or even from the people. But
by the revolution and by the act of settlement, the rights of the
actual monarch, of the reigning family, were made to emanate
from the parliament and the people. In technical language, in
the grave and respectful theory of our constitution, the Crown
is still the fountain from which law and justice spring forth.
Its prerogatives are in the main the same as under the Tudors
and the Stuarts; but the right of the house of Brunswick to
exercise them can only be deduced from the convention of 1688.</p>

<p>The great advantage therefore of the revolution, as I would
explicitly affirm, consists in that which was reckoned its reproach
by many, and its misfortune by more; that it broke the line of
succession. No other remedy could have been found, according
to the temper and prejudices of those times, against the unceasing
conspiracy of power. But when the very tenure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
power was conditional, when the Crown, as we may say, gave
recognisances for its good behaviour, when any violent and
concerted aggressions on public liberty would have ruined those
who could only resist an inveterate faction by the arms which
liberty put in their hands, the several parts of the constitution
were kept in cohesion by a tie far stronger than statutes, that
of a common interest in its preservation. The attachment of
James to popery, his infatuation, his obstinacy, his pusillanimity,
nay even the death of the Duke of Gloucester, the life of the
Prince of Wales, the extraordinary permanence and fidelity of
his party, were all the destined means through which our present
grandeur and liberty, our dignity of thinking on matters of
government, have been perfected. Those liberal tenets, which
at the æra of the revolution were maintained but by one denomination
of English party, and rather perhaps on authority
of not very good precedents in our history than of sound general
reasoning, became in the course of the next generation almost
equally the creed of the other, whose long exclusion from
government taught them to solicit the people's favour; and by
the time that Jacobitism was extinguished, had passed into
received maxims of English politics. None at least would care
to call them in question within the walls of parliament; nor
have their opponents been of much credit in the paths of literature.
Yet, as since the extinction of the house of Stuart's
pretensions, and other events of the last half century, we have
seen those exploded doctrines of indefeasible hereditary right
revived under another name, and some have been willing to
misrepresent the transactions of the revolution and the act of
settlement as if they did not absolutely amount to a deposition
of the reigning sovereign, and an election of a new dynasty by
the representatives of the nation in parliament, it may be proper
to state precisely the several votes, and to point out the impossibility
of reconciling them to any gentler construction.</p>

<p><i>Proceedings of the convention.</i>&mdash;The Lords spiritual and temporal,
to the number of about ninety, and an assembly of all
who had sat in any of King Charles's parliaments, with the lord
mayor and fifty of the common council, requested the Prince of
Orange to take upon him the administration after the king's
second flight, and to issue writs for a convention in the usual
manner.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
 This was on the 26th of December; and the convention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
met on the 22nd of January. Their first care was to
address the prince to take the administration of affairs and
disposal of the revenue into his hands, in order to give a kind
of parliamentary sanction to the power he already exercised.
On the 28th of January the Commons, after a debate in which
the friends of the late king made but a faint opposition, came
to their great vote: That King James II., having endeavoured
to subvert the constitution of this kingdom, by breaking the
original contract between king and people, and by the advice
of jesuits and other wicked persons having violated the fundamental
laws, and having withdrawn himself out of the kingdom,
has abdicated the government, and that the throne is thereby
vacant. They resolved unanimously the next day, that it hath
been found by experience inconsistent with the safety and
welfare of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish
prince.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
 This vote was a remarkable triumph of the whig
party, who had contended for the exclusion bill; and, on
account of that endeavour to establish a principle which no one
was now found to controvert, had been subjected to all the
insults and reproaches of the opposite faction. The Lords
agreed with equal unanimity to this vote; which, though it
was expressed only as an abstract proposition, led by a practical
inference to the whole change that the whigs had in view. But
upon the former resolution several important divisions took
place. The first question put, in order to save a nominal allegiance
to the late king, was, whether a regency with the administration
of regal power under the style of King James II. during
the life of the said King James, be the best and safest way to
preserve the protestant religion and the laws of this kingdom?
This was supported both by those peers who really meant to
exclude the king from the enjoyment of power, such as Nottingham,
its great promoter, and by those who, like Clarendon, were
anxious for his return upon terms of security for their religion
and liberty. The motion was lost by fifty-one to forty-nine;
and this seems to have virtually decided, in the judgment of
the house, that James had lost the throne.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
 The Lords then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
resolved that there was an original contract between the king
and people, by fifty-five to forty-six; a position that seems
rather too theoretical, yet necessary at that time, as denying
the divine origin of monarchy, from which its absolute and
indefeasible authority had been plausibly derived. They concurred,
without much debate, in the rest of the Commons' vote;
till they came to the clause that he had abdicated the government,
for which they substituted the word "deserted." They
next omitted the final and most important clause, that the
throne was thereby vacant, by a majority of fifty-five to forty-one.
This was owing to the party of Lord Danby, who asserted
a devolution of the Crown on the Princess of Orange. It
seemed to be tacitly understood by both sides that the infant
child was to be presumed spurious. This at least was a necessary
supposition for the tories, who sought in the idle rumours
of the time an excuse for abandoning his right. As to the
whigs, though they were active in discrediting this unfortunate
boy's legitimacy, their own broad principles of changing the
line of succession rendered it, in point of argument, a superfluous
enquiry. The tories, who had made little resistance to
the vote of abdication, when it was proposed in the Commons,
recovered courage by this difference between the two houses;
and perhaps by observing the king's party to be stronger out
of doors than it had appeared to be, were able to muster 151
voices against 282 in favour of agreeing with the Lords in
leaving out the clause about the vacancy of the throne.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
 There
was still, however, a far greater preponderance of the whigs in
one part of the convention, than of the tories in the other. In
the famous conference that ensued between committees of the
two houses upon these amendments, it was never pretended
that the word "abdication" was used in its ordinary sense, for
a voluntary resignation of the Crown. The Commons did not
practise so pitiful a subterfuge. Nor could the Lords explicitly
maintain, whatever might be the wishes of their managers, that
the king was not expelled and excluded as much by their own
word "desertion" as by that which the lower house had employed.
Their own previous vote against a regency was decisive
upon this point.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
 But as abdication was a gentler term than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
forfeiture, so desertion appeared a still softer method of expressing
the same idea. Their chief objection, however, to the former
word was that it led, or might seem to lead, to the vacancy of
the throne, against which their principal arguments were directed.
They contended that in our government there could be no
interval or vacancy, the heir's right being complete by a demise
of the Crown; so that it would at once render the monarchy
elective, if any other person were designated to the succession.
The Commons did not deny that the present case was one of
election, though they refused to allow that the monarchy was
thus rendered perpetually elective. They asked, supposing a
right to descend upon the next heir, who was that heir to inherit
it; and gained one of their chief advantages by the difficulty of
evading this question. It was indeed evident that, if the Lords
should carry their amendments, an enquiry into the legitimacy
of the Prince of Wales could by no means be dispensed with.
Unless that could be disproved more satisfactorily than they
had reason to hope, they must come back to the inconveniences
of a regency, with the prospect of bequeathing interminable
confusion to their posterity. For, if the descendants of James
should continue in the Roman catholic religion, the nation might
be placed in the ridiculous situation of acknowledging a dynasty
of exiled kings, whose lawful prerogative would be withheld by
another race of protestant regents. It was indeed strange to
apply the provisional substitution of a regent in cases of infancy
or imbecility of mind to a prince of mature age, and full capacity
for the exercise of power. Upon the king's return to England,
this delegated authority must cease of itself; unless supported
by votes of parliament as violent and incompatible with the
regular constitution as his deprivation of the royal title, but far
less secure for the subject, whom the statute of Henry VII. would
shelter in paying obedience to a king de facto; while the fate of
Sir Henry Vane was an awful proof that no other name could give
countenance to usurpation. A great part of the nation not
thirty years before had been compelled by acts of parliament<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
 to
declare upon oath their abhorrence of that traitorous position,
that arms might be taken up by the king's authority against his
person or those commissioned by him, through the influence of
those very tories or loyalists who had now recourse to the identical
distinction between the king's natural and political capacity,
for which the presbyterians had incurred so many reproaches.</p>

<p>In this conference, however, if the whigs had every advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
on the solid grounds of expediency, or rather political necessity,
the tories were as much superior in the mere argument, either
as it regarded the common sense of words, or the principles of
our constitutional law. Even should we admit that an hereditary
king is competent to abdicate the throne in the name of
all his posterity, this could only be intended of a voluntary and
formal cession, not such a constructive abandonment of his
right by misconduct as the Commons had imagined. The word
"forfeiture" might better have answered this purpose; but it
had seemed too great a violence on principles which it was more
convenient to undermine than to assault. Nor would even
forfeiture bear out by analogy the exclusion of an heir, whose
right was not liable to be set aside at the ancestor's pleasure.
It was only by recurring to a kind of paramount, and what I
may call hyper-constitutional law, a mixture of force and regard
to the national good, which is the best sanction of what is done
in revolutions, that the vote of the Commons could be defended.
They proceeded not by the stated rules of the English government,
but the general rights of mankind. They looked not so
much to Magna Charta as the original compact of society, and
rejected Coke and Hale for Hooker and Harrington.</p>

<p>The House of Lords, after this struggle against principles
undoubtedly very novel in the discussions of parliament, gave
way to the strength of circumstance and the steadiness of the
Commons. They resolved not to insist on their amendments
to the original vote; and followed this up by a resolution, that
the Prince and Princess of Orange shall be declared King and
Queen of England, and all the dominions thereunto belonging.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>

But the Commons with a noble patriotism delayed to concur in
this hasty settlement of the Crown, till they should have completed
the declaration of those fundamental rights and liberties
for the sake of which alone they had gone forward with this
great revolution.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
 That declaration, being at once an exposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of the misgovernment which had compelled them to dethrone
the late king, and of the conditions upon which they elected his
successors, was incorporated in the final resolution to which
both houses came on the 13th of February, extending the limitation
of the Crown as far as the state of affairs required: "That
William and Mary, Prince and Princess of Orange, be, and be
declared King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, and
the dominions thereunto belonging, to hold the crown and
dignity of the said kingdoms and dominions to them, the said
prince and princess, during their lives, and the life of the survivor
of them; and that the sole and full exercise of the regal
power be only in, and executed by, the said Prince of Orange,
in the names of the said prince and princess, during their joint
lives; and after their decease the said crown and royal dignity of
the said kingdoms and dominions to be to the heirs of the body of
the said princess; for default of such issue, to the Princess Anne
of Denmark, and the heirs of her body; and for default of such
issue, to the heirs of the body of the said Prince of Orange."</p>

<p>Thus, to sum up the account of this extraordinary change in
our established monarchy, the convention pronounced, under
the slight disguise of a word unusual in the language of English
law, that the actual sovereign had forfeited his right to the
nation's allegiance. It swept away by the same vote the
reversion of his posterity, and of those who could claim the
inheritance of the Crown. It declared that, during an interval
of nearly two months, there was no king of England; the
monarchy lying, as it were, in abeyance from the 23rd of December
to the 13th of February. It bestowed the Crown on William
jointly with his wife indeed, but so that her participation of the
sovereignty should be only in name.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
 It postponed the succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of the Princess Anne during his life. Lastly, it made no
provision for any future devolution of the Crown in failure of
issue from those to whom it was thus limited, leaving that to
the wisdom of future parliaments. Yet only eight years before,
nay much less, a large part of the nation had loudly proclaimed
the incompetency of a full parliament, with a lawful king at its
head, to alter the lineal course of succession. No whig had then
openly professed the doctrine, that not only a king, but an
entire royal family, might be set aside for public convenience.
The notion of an original contract was denounced as a republican
chimera. The deposing of kings was branded as the worst birth
of popery and fanaticism. If other revolutions have been more
extensive in their effect on the established government, few
perhaps have displayed a more rapid transition of public opinion.
For it cannot be reasonably doubted that the majority of the
nation went along with the vote of their representatives. Such
was the termination of that contest, which the house of Stuart
had obstinately maintained against the liberties, and of late,
against the religion of England; or rather, of that far more
ancient controversy between the Crown and the people which
had never been wholly at rest since the reign of John. During
this long period, the balance, except in a few irregular intervals,
had been swayed in favour of the Crown; and, though the
government of England was always a monarchy limited by law,
though it always, or at least since the admission of the commons
into the legislature, partook of the three simple forms, yet the
character of a monarchy was evidently prevalent over the other
parts of the constitution. But, since the revolution of 1688,
and particularly from thence to the death of George II., it seems
equally just to say, that the predominating character has been
aristocratical; the prerogative being in some respects too
limited, and in others too little capable of effectual exercise, to
counterbalance the hereditary peerage, and that class of great
territorial proprietors, who, in a political division, are to be
reckoned among the proper aristocracy of the kingdom. This,
however, will be more fully explained in the two succeeding
chapters, which are to terminate the present work.

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="s08">ON THE REIGN OF WILLIAM III.</span></h2>

<p>The Revolution is not to be considered as a mere effort of the
nation on a pressing emergency to rescue itself from the violence
of a particular monarch; much less as grounded upon the
danger of the Anglican church, its emoluments, and dignities,
from the bigotry of a hostile religion. It was rather the triumph
of those principles which, in the language of the present day, are
denominated liberal or constitutional, over those of absolute
monarchy, or of monarchy not effectually controlled by stated
boundaries. It was the termination of a contest between the
regal power and that of parliament, which could not have been
brought to so favourable an issue by any other means. But,
while the chief renovation in the spirit of our government was
likely to spring from breaking the line of succession, while no
positive enactments would have sufficed to give security to
freedom with the legitimate race of Stuart on the throne, it
would have been most culpable, and even preposterous, to
permit this occasion to pass by, without asserting and defining
those rights and liberties, which the very indeterminate nature
of the king's prerogative at common law, as well as the unequivocal
extension it had lately received, must continually
place in jeopardy. The House of Lords indeed, as I have
observed in the last chapter, would have conferred the Crown on
William and Mary, leaving the redress of grievances to future
arrangement; and some eminent lawyers in the Commons,
Maynard and Pollexfen, seem to have had apprehensions of
keeping the nation too long in a state of anarchy.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
 But the
great majority of the Commons wisely resolved to go at once to
the root of the nation's grievances, and show their new sovereign
that he was raised to the throne for the sake of those liberties,
by violating which his predecessor had forfeited it.</p>

<p><i>Declaration of rights.</i>&mdash;The declaration of rights presented to
the Prince of Orange by the Marquis of Halifax, as speaker of the
Lords, in the presence of both houses, on the 18th of February,
consists of three parts: a recital of the illegal and arbitrary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
acts committed by the late king, and of their consequent vote
of abdication; a declaration, nearly following the words of the
former part, that such enumerated acts are illegal; and a resolution,
that the throne shall be filled by the Prince and Princess of
Orange, according to the limitations mentioned in the last
chapter. Thus the declaration of rights was indissolubly connected
with the revolution-settlement, as its motive and its
condition.</p>

<p>The Lords and Commons in this instrument declare: That
the pretended power of suspending laws, and the execution of
laws, by regal authority without consent of parliament, is
illegal; That the pretended power of dispensing with laws by
regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late,
is illegal; That the commission for creating the late court of
commissioners for ecclesiastical causes, and all other commissions
and courts of the like nature, are illegal and pernicious;
That levying of money for or to the use of the Crown, by
pretence of prerogative without grant of parliament, for longer
time or in any other manner than the same is or shall be granted,
is illegal; That it is the right of the subjects to petition the
king, and that all commitments or prosecutions for such petitions
are illegal; That the raising or keeping a standing army within
the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent of parliament,
is illegal; That the subjects which are protestants may
have arms for their defence suitable to their condition, and as
allowed by law; That elections of members of parliament ought
to be free; That the freedom of speech or debates, or proceedings
in parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any
court or place out of parliament; That excessive bail ought
not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishments inflicted; That juries ought to be duly
impanelled and returned, and that jurors which pass upon men
in trials of high treason ought to be freeholders; That all grants
and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons, before
conviction, are illegal and void; And that, for redress of all
grievances, and for the amending, strengthening, and preserving
of the laws, parliaments ought to be held frequently.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Bill of rights.</i>&mdash;This declaration was, some months afterwards,
confirmed by a regular act of the legislature in the bill of rights,
which establishes at the same time the limitation of the Crown
according to the vote of both houses, and adds the important
provision; That all persons who shall hold communion with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
church of Rome, or shall marry a papist, shall be excluded, and
for ever incapable to possess, inherit, or enjoy the Crown and
government of this realm; and in all such cases, the people of
these realms shall be absolved from their allegiance, and the
Crown shall descend to the next heir. This was as near an
approach to a generalisation of the principle of resistance as
could be admitted with any security for public order.</p>

<p>The bill of rights contained only one clause extending rather
beyond the propositions laid down in the declaration. This
relates to the dispensing power, which the Lords had been unwilling
absolutely to condemn. They softened the general
assertion of its illegality sent up from the other house, by
inserting the words "as it has been exercised of late."<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
 In the
bill of rights therefore a clause was introduced, that no dispensation
by non obstante to any statute should be allowed, except
in such cases as should be specially provided for by a bill to be
passed during the present session. This reservation went to
satisfy the scruples of the Lords, who did not agree without
difficulty to the complete abolition of a prerogative, so long
recognised, and in many cases so convenient.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
 But the palpable
danger of permitting it to exist in its indefinite state, subject
to the interpretation of time-serving judges, prevailed with the
Commons over this consideration of conveniency; and though
in the next parliament the judges were ordered by the House of
Lords to draw a bill for the king's dispensing in such cases
wherein they should find it necessary, and for abrogating such
laws as had been usually dispensed with and were become useless,
the subject seems to have received no further attention.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
</p>

<p>Except in this article of the dispensing prerogative, we cannot
say, on comparing the bill of rights with what is proved to be
the law by statutes, or generally esteemed to be such on the
authority of our best writers, that it took away any legal power
of the Crown, or enlarged the limits of popular and parliamentary
privilege. The most questionable proposition, though at the
same time one of the most important, was that which asserts the
illegality of a standing army in time of peace, unless with consent
of parliament. It seems difficult to perceive in what respect
this infringed on any private man's right, or by what clear
reason (for no statute could be pretended) the king was debarred
from enlisting soldiers by voluntary contract for the defence of
his dominions, especially after an express law had declared the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
sole power over the militia, without giving any definition of that
word, to reside in the Crown. This had never been expressly
maintained by Charles II.'s parliaments; though the general
repugnance of the nation to what was certainly an innovation
might have provoked a body of men, who did not always
measure their words, to declare its illegality.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
 It was however
at least unconstitutional, by which, as distinguished from
illegal, I mean a novelty of much importance, tending to endanger
the established laws. And it is manifest that the king
could never inflict penalties by martial law, or generally by any
other course, on his troops, nor quarter them on the inhabitants,
nor cause them to interfere with the civil authorities; so that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
even if the proposition so absolutely expressed may be somewhat
too wide, it still should be considered as virtually correct.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>

But its distinct assertion in the bill of rights put a most essential
restraint on the monarchy, and rendered it in effect for ever
impossible to employ any direct force or intimidation against the
established laws and liberties of the people.</p>

<p><i>Discontent with the new government.</i>&mdash;A revolution so thoroughly
remedial, and accomplished with so little cost of private suffering,
so little of angry punishment or oppression of the vanquished,
ought to have been hailed with unbounded thankfulness and
satisfaction. The nation's deliverer and chosen sovereign, in
himself the most magnanimous and heroic character of that
age, might have expected no return but admiration and gratitude.
Yet this was very far from being the case. In no period
of time under the Stuarts were public discontent and opposition
of parliament more prominent than in the reign of William III.;
and that high-souled prince enjoyed far less of his subject's
affection than Charles II. No part of our history perhaps is
read upon the whole with less satisfaction than these thirteen
years, during which he sat upon his elective throne. It will be
sufficient for me to sketch generally the leading causes, and
the errors both of the prince and people, which hindered the
blessings of the revolution from being duly appreciated by its
contemporaries.</p>

<p>The votes of the two houses, that James had abdicated, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
in plainer words forfeited, his royal authority, that the crown
was vacant, that one out of the regular line of succession should
be raised to it, were so untenable by any known law, so repugnant
to the principles of the established church, that a
nation accustomed to think upon matters of government only
as lawyers and churchmen dictated, could not easily reconcile
them to its preconceived notions of duty. The first burst of
resentment against the late king was mitigated by his fall;
compassion, and even confidence, began to take place of it;
his adherents&mdash;some denying or extenuating the faults of his
administration, others more artfully representing them as
capable of redress by legal measures&mdash;having recovered from
their consternation, took advantage of the necessary delay
before the meeting of the convention, and of the time consumed
in its debates, to publish pamphlets and circulate rumours in his
behalf.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
 Thus, at the moment when William and Mary were
proclaimed (though it may be probable that a majority of the
kingdom sustained the bold votes of its representatives), there
was yet a very powerful minority who believed the constitution
to be most violently shaken, if not irretrievably destroyed,
and the rightful sovereign to have been excluded by usurpation.
The clergy were moved by pride and shame, by the just apprehension
that their influence over the people would be impaired,
by jealousy or hatred of the nonconformists, to deprecate so
practical a confutation of the doctrines they had preached,
especially when an oath of allegiance to their new sovereign
came to be imposed; and they had no alternative but to resign
their benefices, or wound their reputation and consciences by
submission upon some casuistical pretext.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
 Eight bishops,
including the primate and several of those who had been foremost
in the defence of the church during the late reign, with
about four hundred clergy, some of them highly distinguished,
chose the more honourable course of refusing the new oaths;
and thus began the schism of the non-jurors, more mischievous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
in its commencement than its continuance, and not so dangerous
to the government of William III. and George I. as the false
submission of less sincere men.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
</p>

<p>It seems undeniable that the strength of this Jacobite faction
sprung from the want of apparent necessity for the change of
government. Extreme oppression produces an impetuous tide
of resistance, which bears away the reasonings of the casuists.
But the encroachments of James II., being rather felt in prospect
than much actual injury, left men in a calmer temper, and disposed
to weigh somewhat nicely the nature of the proposed
remedy. The revolution was, or at least seemed to be, a case
of political expediency; and expediency is always a matter of
uncertain argument. In many respects it was far better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
conducted, more peaceably, more moderately, with less passion
and severity towards the guilty, with less mixture of democratic
turbulence, with less innovation on the regular laws, than if it
had been that extreme case of necessity which some are apt to
require. But it was obtained on this account with less unanimity
and heartfelt concurrence of the entire nation.</p>

<p><i>Character and errors of William.</i>&mdash;The demeanour of William,
always cold and sometimes harsh, his foreign origin (a sort of
crime in English eyes) and foreign favourites, the natural and
almost laudable prejudice against one who had risen by the
misfortunes of a very near relation, a desire of power not very
judiciously displayed by him, conspired to keep alive this disaffection;
and the opposite party, regardless of all the decencies
of political lying, took care to aggravate it by the vilest
calumnies against one, who, though not exempt from errors,
must be accounted the greatest man of his own age. It is
certain that his government was in very considerable danger for
three or four years after the revolution, and even to the peace
of Ryswick. The change appeared so marvellous, and contrary
to the bent of men's expectation, that it could not be permanent.
Hence he was surrounded by the timid and the treacherous; by
those who meant to have merits to plead after a restoration, and
those who meant at least to be secure. A new and revolutionary
government is seldom fairly dealt with. Mankind, accustomed
to forgive almost everything in favour of legitimate prescriptive
power, exact an ideal faultlessness from that which claims
allegiance on the score of its utility. The personal failings of
its rulers, the negligences of their administration, even the
inevitable privations and difficulties which the nature of human
affairs or the misconduct of their predecessors create, are imputed
to them with invidious minuteness. Those who deem
their own merit unrewarded, become always a numerous and
implacable class of adversaries; those whose schemes of public
improvement have not been followed, think nothing gained by
the change, and return to a restless censoriousness in which they
have been accustomed to place delight. With all these it was
natural that William should have to contend; but we cannot in
justice impute all the unpopularity of his administration to the
disaffection of one party, or the fickleness and ingratitude of
another. It arose in no slight degree from errors of his own.</p>

<p><i>Jealousy of the whigs.</i>&mdash;The king had been raised to the throne
by the vigour and zeal of the whigs; but the opposite party were
so nearly upon an equality in both houses that it would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
been difficult to frame his government on an exclusive basis.
It would also have been highly impolitic, and, with respect to
some few persons, ungrateful, to put a slight upon those who
had an undeniable majority in the most powerful classes.
William acted, therefore, on a wise and liberal principle, in
bestowing offices of trust on Lord Danby, so meritorious in the
revolution, and on Lord Nottingham, whose probity was unimpeached;
while he gave the whigs, as was due, a decided
preponderance in his council. Many of them, however, with
that indiscriminating acrimony which belongs to all factions,
could not endure the elevation of men who had complied with
the court too long, and seemed by their tardy opposition<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
 to be
rather the patriots of the church than of civil liberty. They
remembered that Danby had been impeached as a corrupt and
dangerous minister; that Halifax had been involved, at least
by holding a confidential office at the time, in the last and worst
part of Charles's reign. They saw Godolphin, who had concurred
in the commitment of the bishops, and every other
measure of the late king, still in the treasury; and, though they
could not reproach Nottingham with any misconduct, were
shocked that his conspicuous opposition to the new settlement
should be rewarded with the post of secretary of state. The
mismanagement of affairs in Ireland during 1689, which was
very glaring, furnished specious grounds for suspicion that the
king was betrayed.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
 It is probable that he was so, though not
at that time by the chiefs of his ministry. This was the beginning
of that dissatisfaction with the government of William,
on the part of those who had the most zeal for his throne, which
eventually became far more harassing than the conspiracies of
his real enemies. Halifax gave way to the prejudices of the
Commons, and retired from power. These prejudices were no
doubt unjust, as they respected a man so sound in principle,
though not uniform in conduct, and who had withstood the
arbitrary maxims of Charles and James in that cabinet, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
he unfortunately continued too long a member. But his fall
is a warning to English statesmen, that they will be deemed
responsible to their country for measures which they countenance
by remaining in office, though they may resist them in
council.</p>

<p><i>Bill of indemnity.</i>&mdash;The same honest warmth which impelled
the whigs to murmur at the employment of men sullied by their
compliance with the court, made them unwilling to concur in
the king's desire of a total amnesty. They retained the bill of
indemnity in the Commons; and excepting some by name, and
many more by general clauses, gave their adversaries a pretext
for alarming all those whose conduct had not been irreproachable.
Clemency is indeed for the most part the wisest, as well as the
most generous policy; yet it might seem dangerous to pass over
with unlimited forgiveness that servile obedience to arbitrary
power, especially in the judges, which, as it springs from a base
motive, is best controlled by the fear of punishment. But some
of the late king's instruments had fled with him, others were lost
and ruined; it was better to follow the precedent set at the
restoration, than to give them a chance of regaining public
sympathy by a prosecution out of the regular course of law.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>

In one instance, the expulsion of Sir Robert Sawyer from the
house, the majority displayed a just resentment against one of
the most devoted adherents of the prerogative, so long as civil
liberty alone was in danger. Sawyer had been latterly very
conspicuous in defence of the church; and it was expedient to
let the nation see that the days of Charles II. were not entirely
forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
 Nothing was concluded as to the indemnity in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
parliament; but in the next, William took the matter into his
own hands by sending down an act of grace.</p>

<p><i>Bill for restoring corporations.</i>&mdash;I scarcely venture, at this
distance from the scene, to pronounce an opinion as to the
clause introduced by the whigs into a bill for restoring corporations,
which excluded for the space of seven years all who had
acted or even concurred in surrendering charters from municipal
offices of trust. This was no doubt intended to maintain their
own superiority by keeping the church or tory faction out of
corporations. It evidently was not calculated to assuage the
prevailing animosities. But, on the other hand, the cowardly
submissiveness of the others to the quo warrantos seemed at
least to deserve this censure; and the measure could by no
means be put on a level in point of rigour with the corporation
act of Charles II. As the dissenters, unquestioned friends of
the revolution, had been universally excluded by that statute,
and the tories had lately been strong enough to prevent their
re-admission, it was not unfair for the opposite party, or rather
for the government, to provide some security against men, who,
in spite of their oaths of allegiance, were not likely to have
thoroughly abjured their former principles. This clause, which
modern historians generally condemn as oppressive, had the
strong support of Mr. Somers, then solicitor-general. It was,
however, lost through the court's conjunction with the tories
in the lower house, and the bill itself fell to the ground in the
upper; so that those who had come into corporations by very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
ill means retained their power, to the great disadvantage of the
revolution party; as the next elections made appear.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
</p>

<p>But if the whigs behaved in these instances with too much
of that passion, which, though offensive and mischievous in its
excess, is yet almost inseparable from patriotism and incorrupt
sentiments in so numerous an assembly as the House of Commons,
they amply redeemed their glory by what cost them the new
king's favour, their wise and admirable settlement of the
revenue.</p>

<p><i>Settlement of the revenue.</i>&mdash;The first parliament of Charles II.
had fixed on £1,200,000 as the ordinary revenue of the Crown,
sufficient in times of no peculiar exigency for the support of its
dignity and for the public defence. For this they provided
various resources; the hereditary excise on liquors granted in
lieu of the king's feudal rights, other excise and custom duties
granted for his life, the post-office, the crown lands, the tax
called hearth money, or two shillings for every house, and some
of smaller consequence. These in the beginning of that reign
fell short of the estimate; but before its termination, by the
improvement of trade and stricter management of the customs,
they certainly exceeded that sum. For the revenue of James
from these sources, on an average of the four years of his
reign, amounted to £1,500,964; to which something more than
£400,000 is to be added for the produce of duties imposed for
eight years by his parliament of 1685.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
</p>

<p>William appears to have entertained no doubt that this great
revenue, as well as all the power and prerogative of the Crown,
became vested in himself as King of England, or at least ought
to be instantly settled by parliament according to the usual
method.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
 There could indeed be no pretence for disputing his
right to the hereditary excise, though this seems to have been
questioned in debate; but the Commons soon displayed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
considerable reluctance to grant the temporary revenue for the
king's life. This had been done for several centuries in the first
parliament of every reign. But the accounts, for which they
called on this occasion, exhibited so considerable an increase of
the receipts on one hand, so alarming a disposition of the expenditure
on the other, that they deemed it expedient to restrain
a liberality, which was not only likely to go beyond their intention,
but to place them, at least in future times, too much
within the power of the Crown. Its average expenses appeared
to have been £1,700,000. Of this £610,000 was the charge of
the late king's army, and £83,493 of the ordnance. Nearly
£90,000 was set under the suspicious head of secret service,
imprested to Mr. Guy, secretary of the treasury.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
 Thus it was
evident that, far from sinking below the proper level, as had been
the general complaint of the court in the Stuart reigns, the
revenue was greatly and dangerously above it; and its excess
might either be consumed in unnecessary luxury, or diverted
to the worse purposes of despotism and corruption. They had
indeed just declared a standing army to be illegal. But there
could be no such security for the observance of this declaration
as the want of means in the Crown to maintain one. Their
experience of the interminable contention about supply, which
had been fought with various success between the kings of
England and their parliaments for some hundred years, dictated
a course to which they wisely and steadily adhered, and to
which, perhaps above all other changes at this revolution, the
augmented authority of the House of Commons must be
ascribed.</p>

<p><i>Appropriation of supplies.</i>&mdash;They began by voting that
£1,200,000 should be the annual revenue of the Crown in time of
peace; and that one half of this should be appropriated to the
maintenance of the king's government and royal family, or
what is now called the civil list, the other to the public defence
and contingent expenditure.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
 The breaking out of an eight
years' war rendered it impossible to carry into effect these
resolutions as to the peace establishment: but they did not lose
sight of their principle, that the king's regular and domestic
expenses should be determined by a fixed annual sum, distinct
from the other departments of public service. They speedily
improved upon their original scheme of a definite revenue, by
taking a more close and constant superintendence of these
departments, the navy, army, and ordnance. Estimates of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
probable expenditure were regularly laid before them, and the
supply granted was strictly appropriated to each particular
service.</p>

<p>This great and fundamental principle, as it has long been
justly considered, that the money voted by parliament is appropriated,
and can only be applied, to certain specified heads of
expenditure, was introduced, as I have before mentioned, in
the reign of Charles II., and generally, though not in every
instance, adopted by his parliament. The unworthy House of
Commons that sat in 1685, not content with a needless augmentation
of the revenue, took credit with the king for not
having appropriated their supplies.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
 But from the revolution
it has been the invariable usage. The lords of the treasury,
by a clause annually repeated in the appropriation act of every
session, are forbidden, under severe penalties, to order by their
warrant any monies in the exchequer, so appropriated, from
being issued for any other service, and the officers of the exchequer
to obey any such warrant. This has given the House of
Commons so effectual a control over the executive power, or,
more truly speaking, has rendered it so much a participator in
that power, that no administration can possibly subsist without
its concurrence; nor can the session of parliament be intermitted
for an entire year, without leaving both the naval and military
force of the kingdom unprovided for. In time of war, or in
circumstances that may induce war, it has not been very uncommon
to deviate a little from the rule of appropriation, by a
grant of considerable sums on a vote of credit, which the Crown
is thus enabled to apply at its discretion during the recess of
parliament; and we have had also too frequent experience, that
the charges of public service have not been brought within the
limits of the last year's appropriation. But the general principle
has not perhaps been often transgressed without sufficient
reason; and a House of Commons would be deeply responsible
to the country, if through supine confidence it should abandon
that high privilege which has made it the arbiter of court
factions, and the regulator of foreign connections. It is to this
transference of the executive government (for the phrase is
hardly too strong) from the Crown to the two houses of parliament,
and especially the Commons, that we owe the proud
attitude which England has maintained since the revolution,
so extraordinarily dissimilar, in the eyes of Europe, to her
condition, under the Stuarts. The supplies meted out with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
niggardly caution by former parliaments to sovereigns whom
they could not trust, have flowed with redundant profuseness,
when they could judge of their necessity and direct their application.
Doubtless the demand has always been fixed by the
ministers of the Crown, and its influence has retrieved in some
degree the loss of authority; but it is still true that no small
portion of the executive power, according to the established laws
and customs of our government, has passed into the hands of
that body, which prescribes the application of the revenue, as
well as investigates at its pleasure every act of the administration.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Dissatisfaction of the king.</i>&mdash;The convention parliament continued
the revenue, as it already stood, until December 1690.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>

Their successors complied so far with the king's expectation as
to grant the excise duties, besides those that were hereditary,
for the lives of William and Mary, and that of the survivor.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>

The customs they only continued for four years. They provided
extraordinary supplies for the conduct of the war on a scale
of armament, and consequently of expenditure, unparalleled in
the annals of England. But the hesitation, and, as the king
imagined, the distrust they had shown in settling the ordinary
revenue, sunk deep into his mind, and chiefly alienated him
from the whigs, who were stronger and more conspicuous than
their adversaries in the two sessions of 1689. If we believe
Burnet, he felt so indignantly what appeared a systematic endeavour
to reduce his power below the ancient standard of the
monarchy, that he was inclined to abandon the government,
and leave the nation to itself. He knew well, as he told the
bishop, what was to be alleged for the two forms of government,
a monarchy and a commonwealth, and would not
determine which was preferable; but of all forms he thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the worst was that of a monarchy without the necessary
powers.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
</p>

<p>The desire of rule in William III. was as magnanimous and
public-spirited as ambition can ever be in a human bosom. It
was the consciousness not only of having devoted himself to a
great cause, the security of Europe, and especially of Great
Britain and Holland, against unceasing aggression, but of
resources in his own firmness and sagacity which no other
person possessed. A commanding force, a copious revenue, a
supreme authority in councils, were not sought, as by the
crowd of kings, for the enjoyment of selfish vanity and covetousness,
but as the only sure instruments of success in his high
calling, in the race of heroic enterprise which Providence had
appointed for the elect champion of civil and religious liberty.
We can hardly wonder that he should not quite render justice
to the motives of those who seemed to impede his strenuous
energies; that he should resent as ingratitude those precautions
against abuse of power by him, the recent deliverer of the
nation, which it had never called for against those who had
sought to enslave it.</p>

<p>But reasonable as this apology may be, it was still an unhappy
error of William that he did not sufficiently weigh the
circumstances which had elevated him to the English throne,
and the alteration they had inevitably made in the relations
between the Crown and the parliament. Chosen upon the
popular principle of general freedom and public good, on the
ruins of an ancient hereditary throne, he could expect to reign
on no other terms than as the chief of a commonwealth, with
no other authority than the sense of the nation and of parliament
deemed congenial to the new constitution. The debt of
gratitude to him was indeed immense, and not sufficiently
remembered; but it was due for having enabled the nation to
regenerate itself, and to place barriers against future assaults,
to provide securities against future misgovernment. No one
could seriously assert that James II. was the only sovereign of
whom there had been cause to complain. In almost every reign,
on the contrary, which our history records, the innate love of
arbitrary power had produced more or less of oppression. The
revolution was chiefly beneficial, as it gave a stronger impulse
to the desire of political liberty, and rendered it more extensively
attainable. It was certainly not for the sake of replacing James
by William with equal powers of doing injury, that the purest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and wisest patriots engaged in that cause; but as the sole means
of making a royal government permanently compatible with
freedom and justice. The bill of rights had pretended to do
nothing more than stigmatise some recent proceedings: were
the representatives of the nation to stop short of other measures,
because they seemed novel and restrictive of the Crown's
authority, when for the want of them the Crown's authority
had nearly freed itself from all restriction? Such was their true
motive for limiting the revenue, and such the ample justification
of those important statutes enacted in the course of this reign,
which the king, unfortunately for his reputation and peace of
mind, too jealously resisted.</p>

<p><i>No republican party in existence.</i>&mdash;It is by no means unusual
to find mention of a commonwealth or republican party, as if it
existed in some force at the time of the revolution, and throughout
the reign of William III.; nay some writers, such as Hume,
Dalrymple, and Somerville, have, by putting them in a sort of
balance against the Jacobites, as the extremes of the whig and
tory factions, endeavoured to persuade us that the one was as
substantial and united a body as the other. It may, however,
be confidently asserted, that no republican party had any existence;
if by that word we are to understand a set of men whose
object was the abolition of our limited monarchy. There might
unquestionably be persons, especially among the independent
sect, who cherished the memory of what they called the good
old cause, and thought civil liberty irreconcilable with any form
of regal government. But these were too inconsiderable, and
too far removed from political influence, to deserve the appellation
of a party. I believe it would be difficult to name five
individuals, to whom even a speculative preference of a commonwealth
may with probability be ascribed. Were it otherwise,
the numerous pamphlets of this period would bear witness to
their activity. Yet, with the exception perhaps of one or two,
and those rather equivocal, we should search, I suspect, the
collections of that time in vain for any manifestations of a
republican spirit. If indeed an ardent zeal to see the prerogative
effectually restrained, to vindicate that high authority
of the House of Commons over the executive administration
which it has in fact claimed and exercised, to purify the house
itself from corrupt influence, if a tendency to dwell upon the
popular origin of civil society, and the principles which Locke,
above other writers, had brought again into fashion, be called
republican (as in a primary but less usual sense of the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
they may), no one can deny that this spirit eminently
characterised the age of William III. And schemes of reformation
emanating from this source were sometimes offered to
the world, trenching more perhaps on the established constitution
than either necessity demanded or prudence warranted.
But these were anonymous and of little influence; nor
did they ever extend to the absolute subversion of the
throne.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
</p>

<p><i>William employs tories in ministry.</i>&mdash;William, however, was
very early led to imagine, whether through the insinuations of
Lord Nottingham, as Burnet pretends, or the natural prejudice
of kings against those who do not comply with them, that there
not only existed a republican party, but that it numbered many
supporters among the principal whigs. He dissolved the convention-parliament;
and gave his confidence for some time to
the opposite faction.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
 But, among these, a real disaffection to
his government prevailed so widely that he could with difficulty
select men sincerely attached to it. The majority professed
only to pay allegiance as to a sovereign <i>de facto</i>, and violently
opposed the bill of recognition in 1690, both on account of the
words rightful and lawful king which it applied to William, and
of its declaring the laws passed in the last parliament to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
been good and valid.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
 They had influence enough with the king
to defeat a bill proposed by the whigs, by which an oath of
abjuration of James's right was to be taken by all persons in
trust.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
 It is by no means certain that even those who abstained
from all connection with James after his loss of the throne,
would have made a strenuous resistance in case of his landing
to recover it.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
 But we know that a large proportion of the
tories were engaged in a confederacy to support him. Almost
every peer, in fact, of any consideration among that party, with
the exception of Lord Nottingham, is implicated by the secret
documents which Macpherson and Dalrymple have brought to
light; especially Godolphin, Carmarthen, and Marlborough, the
second at that time prime minister of William (as he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
justly be called), the last with circumstances of extraordinary
and abandoned treachery towards his country as well as his
allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
 Two of the most distinguished whigs (and if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
imputation is not fully substantiated against others<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
 by name,
we know generally that many were liable to it), forfeited a high
name among their contemporaries, in the eyes of a posterity
which has known them better; the Earl of Shrewsbury, from
that strange feebleness of soul which hung like a spell upon his
nobler qualities, and Admiral Russell, from insolent pride and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
sullenness of temper. Both these were engaged in the vile
intrigues of a faction they abhorred; but Shrewsbury soon
learned again to revere the sovereign he had contributed to
raise, and withdrew from the contamination of Jacobitism. It
does not appear that he betrayed that trust which William is
said with extraordinary magnanimity to have reposed on him,
after a full knowledge of his connection with the court of St.
Germain.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
 But Russell, though compelled to win the battle of
La Hogue against his will, took care to render his splendid victory
as little advantageous as possible. The credulity and almost
wilful blindness of faction is strongly manifested in the conduct
of the House of Commons as to the quarrel between this commander
and the board of admiralty. They chose to support
one who was secretly a traitor, because he bore the name of
whig, tolerating his infamous neglect of duty and contemptible
excuses; in order to pull down an honest, though not very able
minister, who belonged to the tories.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
 But they saw clearly
that the king was betrayed, though mistaken, in this instance,
as to the persons; and were right in concluding that the men
who had effected the revolution were in general most likely to
maintain it; or, in the words of a committee of the whole house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
"That his majesty be humbly advised, for the necessary support
of his government, to employ in his councils and management
of his affairs such persons only whose principles oblige them to
stand by him and his right against the late King James, and all
other pretenders whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
 It is plain from this and other
votes of the Commons, that the tories had lost that majority which
they seem to have held in the first session of this parliament.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be inferred from this extensive combination
in favour of the banished king, that his party embraced
the majority of the nation, or that he could have been restored
with any general testimonies of satisfaction. The friends of the
revolution were still by far the more powerful body. Even the
secret emissaries of James confess that the common people were
strongly prejudiced against his return. His own enumeration
of peers attached to his cause cannot be brought to more than
thirty, exclusive of catholics;<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
 and the real Jacobites were, I
believe, in a far less proportion among the Commons. The
hopes of that wretched victim of his own bigotry and violence
rested less on the loyalty of his former subjects, or on their
disaffection to his rival, than on the perfidious conspiracy of
English statesmen and admirals, of lord-lieutenants and governors
of towns, and on so numerous a French army as an ill-defended
and disunited kingdom would be incapable to resist.
He was to return, not as his brother, alone and unarmed, strong
only in the consentient voice of the nation, but amidst the
bayonets of 30,000 French auxiliaries. These were the pledges
of just and constitutional rule, whom our patriot Jacobites
invoked against the despotism of William III. It was from a
king of the house of Stuart, from James II., from one thus
encircled by the soldiers of Louis XIV., that we were to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the guarantee of civil and religious liberty. Happily the determined
love of arbitrary power, burning unextinguished amidst
exile and disgrace, would not permit him to promise, in any
distinct manner, those securities which a large portion of his
own adherents required. The Jacobite faction was divided
between compounders and non-compounders; the one insisting
on the necessity of holding forth a promise of such new enactments
upon the king's restoration as might remove all jealousies
as to the rights of the church and people; the other, more agreeably
to James's temper, rejecting every compromise with what
they called the republican party at the expense of his ancient
prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
 In a declaration which he issued from St. Germain
in 1692 there was so little acknowledgment of error, so
few promises of security, so many exceptions from the amnesty
he offered, that the wiser of his partisans in England were willing
to insinuate that it was not authentic.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
 This declaration, and
the virulence of Jacobite pamphlets in the same tone, must have
done harm to his cause.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
 He published another declaration
next year at the earnest request of those who had seceded to
his side from that of the revolution, in which he held forth
more specific assurances of consenting to a limitation of his
prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
 But no reflecting man could avoid perceiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
that such promises wrung from his distress were illusory and
insincere, that in the exultation of triumphant loyalty, even
without the sword of the Gaul thrown into the scale of despotism,
those who dreamed of a conditional restoration and of fresh
guarantees for civil liberty, would find, like the presbyterians
of 1660, that it became them rather to be anxious about their
own pardon, and to receive it as a signal boon of the king's
clemency. The knowledge thus obtained of James's incorrigible
obstinacy seems gradually to have convinced the disaffected
that no hope for the nation or for themselves could be drawn
from his restoration.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
 His connections with the treacherous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
counsellors of William grew weaker; and even before the peace
of Ryswick it was evident that the aged bigot could never
wield again the sceptre he had thrown away. The scheme of
assassinating our illustrious sovereign, which some of James's
desperate zealots had devised without his privity, as may charitably
and even reasonably be supposed,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
 gave a fatal blow to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the interests of that faction. It was instantly seen that the
murmurs of malecontent whigs had nothing in common with
the disaffection of Jacobites. The nation resounded with an
indignant cry against the atrocious conspiracy. An association
abjuring the title of James, and pledging the subscribers to
revenge the king's death, after the model of that in the reign
of Elizabeth, was generally signed by both houses of parliament,
and throughout the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
 The adherents of the exiled
family dwindled into so powerless a minority that they could
make no sort of opposition to the act of settlement, and did not
recover an efficient character as a party till towards the latter
end of the ensuing reign.</p>

<p><i>Attainder of Sir John Fenwick.</i>&mdash;Perhaps the indignation of
parliament against those who sought to bring back despotism
through civil war and the murder of an heroic sovereign, was
carried too far in the bill for attainting Sir John Fenwick of
treason. Two witnesses, required by our law in a charge of
that nature, Porter and Goodman, had deposed before the grand
jury to Fenwick's share in the scheme of invasion, though there
is no reason to believe that he was privy to the intended assassination
of the king. His wife subsequently prevailed on Goodman
to quit the kingdom; and thus it became impossible to
obtain a conviction in the course of law. This was the apology
for a special act of the legislature, by which he suffered the
penalties of treason. It did not, like some other acts of attainder,
inflict a punishment beyond the offence, but supplied the
deficiency of legal evidence. It was sustained by the production
of Goodman's examination before the privy council, and by
the evidence of two grand-jurymen as to the deposition he had
made on oath before them, and on which they had found the
bill of indictment. It was also shown that he had been tampered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
with by Lady Mary Fenwick to leave the kingdom. This
was undoubtedly as good secondary evidence as can well be
imagined; and, though in criminal cases such evidence is not
admissible by courts of law, it was plausibly urged that the
legislature might prevent Fenwick from taking advantage of his
own underhand management, without transgressing the moral
rules of justice, or even setting the dangerous precedent of
punishing treason upon a single testimony. Yet, upon the
whole, the importance of adhering to the stubborn rules of law
in matters of treason is so weighty, and the difficulty of keeping
such a body as the House of Commons within any less precise
limits so manifest, that we may well concur with those who
thought Sir John Fenwick much too inconsiderable a person to
warrant such an anomaly. The jealous sense of liberty prevalent
in William's reign produced a very strong opposition to
this bill of attainder; it passed in each house, especially in the
Lords, by a small majority.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
 Nor perhaps would it have been
carried but for Fenwick's imprudent disclosure, in order to save
his life, of some great statesmen's intrigues with the late king;
a disclosure which he dared not, or was not in a situation to
confirm, but which rendered him the victim of their fear and
revenge. Russell, one of those accused, brought into the
Commons the bill of attainder; Marlborough voted in favour
of it, the only instance wherein he quitted the tories; Godolphin
and Bath, with more humanity, took the other side; and
Shrewsbury absented himself from the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
 It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
now well known that Fenwick's discoveries went not a step
beyond the truth. Their effect, however, was beneficial to the
state; as by displaying a strange want of secrecy in the court
of St. Germains, Fenwick never having had any direct communication
with those he accused, it caused Godolphin and
Marlborough to break off their dangerous course of perfidy.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Ill success of the war.</i>&mdash;Amidst these scenes of dissension and
disaffection, and amidst the public losses and decline which
aggravated them, we have scarce any object to contemplate
with pleasure, but the magnanimous and unconquerable soul of
William. Mistaken in some parts of his domestic policy, unsuited
by some failings of his character for the English nation,
it is still to his superiority in virtue and energy over all her own
natives in that age that England is indebted for the preservation
of her honour and liberty; not at the crisis only of the revolution,
but through the difficult period that elapsed until the
peace of Ryswick. A war of nine years, generally unfortunate,
unsatisfactory in its result, carried on at a cost unknown to
former times, amidst the decay of trade, the exhaustion of
resources, the decline, as there seems good reason to believe,
of population itself, was the festering wound that turned a
people's gratitude into factiousness and treachery. It was easy
to excite the national prejudices against campaigns in Flanders,
especially when so unsuccessful, and to inveigh against the
neglect of our maritime power. Yet, unless we could have been
secure against invasion, which Louis would infallibly have
attempted, had not his whole force been occupied by the grand
alliance, and which, in the feeble condition of our navy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
commerce, at one time could not have been impracticable, the
defeats of Steenkirk and Landen might probably have been
sustained at home. The war of 1689, and the great confederacy
of Europe, which William alone could animate with any steadiness
and energy, were most evidently and undeniably the means
of preserving the independence of England. That danger,
which has sometimes been in our countrymen's mouths with
little meaning, of becoming a province to France, was then
close and actual; for I hold the restoration of the house of
Stuart to be but another expression for that ignominy and
servitude.</p>

<p><i>Expenses of the war.</i>&mdash;The expense therefore of this war must
not be reckoned unnecessary; nor must we censure the government
for that small portion of our debt which it was compelled
to entail on posterity.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
 It is to the honour of William's administration,
and of his parliaments, not always clear-sighted, but
honest and zealous for the public weal, that they deviated so
little from the praiseworthy, though sometimes impracticable,
policy of providing a revenue commensurate with the annual
expenditure. The supplies annually raised during the war were
about five millions, more than double the revenue of James II.
But a great decline took place in the produce of the taxes by
which that revenue was levied. In 1693, the customs had
dwindled to less than half their amount before the revolution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the excise duties to little more than half.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
 This rendered heavy
impositions on land inevitable; a tax always obnoxious, and
keeping up disaffection in the most powerful class of the community.
The first land-tax was imposed in 1690, at the rate
of three shillings in the pound on the rental; and it continued
ever afterwards to be annually granted, at different rates, but
commonly at four shillings in the pound, till it was made perpetual
in 1798. A tax of twenty per cent. might well seem
grievous; and the notorious inequality of the assessment in
different counties tended rather to aggravate the burthen upon
those whose contribution was the fairest. Fresh schemes of
finance were devised, and, on the whole, patiently borne by a
jaded people. The Bank of England rose under the auspices
of the whig party, and materially relieved the immediate exigencies
of the government, while it palliated the general distress,
by discounting bills and lending money at an easier rate of
interest. Yet its notes were depreciated twenty per cent. in
exchange for silver; and exchequer tallies at least twice as much,
till they were funded at an interest of eight per cent.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
 But,
these resources generally falling very short of calculation, and
being anticipated at such an exorbitant discount, a constantly
increasing deficiency arose; and public credit sunk so low, that
about the year 1696 it was hardly possible to pay the fleet and
army from month to month, and a total bankruptcy seemed
near at hand. These distresses again were enhanced by the
depreciation of the circulating coin, and by the bold remedy of
a re-coinage, which made the immediate stagnation of commerce
more complete. The mere operation of exchanging the worn
silver coin for the new, which Mr. Montague had the courage
to do without lowering the standard, cost the government two
millions and a half. Certainly the vessel of our commonwealth
has never been so close to shipwreck as in this period; we have
seen the storm raging in still greater terror round our heads,
but with far stouter planks and tougher cables to confront and
ride through it.</p>

<p>Those who accused William of neglecting the maritime force
of England, knew little what they said, or cared little about its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
truth.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
 A soldier and a native of Holland, he naturally looked
to the Spanish Netherlands as the theatre on which the battle
of France and Europe was to be fought. It was by the possession
of that country and its chief fortresses that Louis aspired
to hold Holland in vassalage, to menace the coasts of England,
and to keep the Empire under his influence. And if, with the
assistance of those brave regiments, who learned, in the well-contested
though unfortunate battles of that war, the skill and
discipline which made them conquerors in the next, it was found
that France was still an overmatch for the allies, what would
have been effected against her by the decrepitude of Spain, the
perverse pride of Austria, and the selfish disunion of Germany?
The commerce of France might, perhaps, have suffered more by
an exclusively maritime warfare; but we should have obtained
this advantage, which in itself is none, and would not have
essentially crippled her force, at the price of abandoning to her
ambition the quarry it had so long in pursuit. Meanwhile the
naval annals of this war added much to our renown; Russell,
glorious in his own despite at La Hogue, Rooke, and Shovel
kept up the honour of the English flag. After that great
victory, the enemy never encountered us in battle; and the
wintering of the fleet at Cadiz in 1694, a measure determined on
by William's energetic mind, against the advice of his ministers,
and in spite of the fretful insolence of the admiral, gave us so
decided a pre-eminence both in the Atlantic and Mediterranean
seas, that it is hard to say what more could have been achieved
by the most exclusive attention to the navy.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
 It is true that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
especially during the first part of the war, vast losses were
sustained through the capture of merchant ships; but this is
the inevitable lot of a commercial country, and has occurred in
every war, until the practice of placing the traders under convoy
of armed ships was introduced. And, when we consider the
treachery which pervaded this service, and the great facility
of secret intelligence which the enemy possessed, we may be
astonished that our failures and losses were not still more
decisive.</p>

<p><i>Treaty of Ryswick.</i>&mdash;The treaty of Ryswick was concluded on
at least as fair terms as almost perpetual ill fortune could
warrant us to expect. It compelled Louis XIV. to recognise
the king's title, and thus both humbled the court of St. Germains,
and put an end for several years to its intrigues. It extinguished,
or rather the war itself had extinguished, one of the
bold hopes of the French court, the scheme of procuring the
election of the dauphin to the empire. It gave at least a
breathing time to Europe, so long as the feeble lamp of Charles
II.'s life should continue to glimmer, during which the fate of
his vast succession might possibly be regulated without injury
to the liberties of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
 But to those who looked with the
king's eyes on the prospects of the continent, this pacification
could appear nothing else than a preliminary armistice of vigilance
and preparation. He knew that the Spanish dominions, or at
least as large a portion of them as could be grasped by a powerful
arm, had been for more than thirty years the object of Louis
XIV. The acquisitions of that monarch at Aix-la-Chapelle and
Nimeguen had been comparatively trifling, and seem hardly
enough to justify the dread that Europe felt of his aggressions.

But in contenting himself for the time with a few strong towns,
or a moderate district, he constantly kept in view the weakness
of the King of Spain's constitution. The queen's renunciation
of her right of succession was invalid in the jurisprudence of his
court. Sovereigns, according to the public law of France, uncontrollable
by the rights of others, were incapable of limiting
their own. They might do all things but guarantee the privileges
of their subjects or the independence of foreign states.
By the Queen of France's death, her claim upon the inheritance
of Spain was devolved upon the dauphin; so that ultimately,
and virtually in the first instance, the two great monarchies
would be consolidated, and a single will would direct a force
much more than equal to all the rest of Europe. If we admit
that every little oscillation in the balance of power has sometimes
been too minutely regarded by English statesmen, it
would be absurd to contend, that such a subversion of it as the
union of France and Spain under one head did not most seriously
threaten both the independence of England and Holland.</p>

<p><i>Jealousy of the Commons.</i>&mdash;The House of Commons which sat
at the conclusion of the treaty of Ryswick, chiefly composed of
whigs, and having zealously co-operated in the prosecution of
the late war, could not be supposed lukewarm in the cause of
liberty, or indifferent to the aggrandisement of France. But
the nation's exhausted state seemed to demand an intermission
of its burthens, and revived the natural and laudable disposition
to frugality which had characterised in all former times an
English parliament. The arrears of the war, joined to loans
made during its progress, left a debt of about seventeen millions,
which excited much inquietude, and evidently could not be discharged
but by steady retrenchment and uninterrupted peace.
But, besides this, a reluctance to see a standing army established
prevailed among the great majority both of whigs and tories.
It was unknown to their ancestors&mdash;this was enough for one
party; it was dangerous to liberty&mdash;this alarmed the other.
Men of ability and honest intention, but, like most speculative
politicians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, rather
too fond of seeking analogies in ancient history, influenced the
public opinion by their writings, and carried too far the undeniable
truth, that a large army at the mere control of an
ambitious prince may often overthrow the liberties of a people.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
It was not sufficiently remembered that the bill of rights, the
annual mutiny bill, the necessity of annual votes of supply for
the maintenance of a regular army, besides, what was far more
than all, the publicity of all acts of government, and the strong
spirit of liberty burning in the people, had materially diminished
a danger which it would not be safe entirely to contemn.</p>

<p><i>Army reduced.</i>&mdash;Such, however, was the influence of what
may be called the constitutional antipathy of the English in that
age to a regular army, that the Commons, in the first session
after the peace, voted that all troops raised since 1680 should
be disbanded, reducing the forces to about 7000 men, which
they were with difficulty prevailed upon to augment to 10,000.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>

They resolved at the same time that, "in a just sense and
acknowledgment of what great things his majesty has done for
these kingdoms, a sum not exceeding £700,000 be granted to his
majesty during his life, for the support of the civil list." So
ample a gift from an impoverished nation is the strongest testimony
of their affection to the king.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
 But he was justly disappointed
by the former vote, which, in the hazardous condition
of Europe, prevented this country from wearing a countenance
of preparation, more likely to avert than to bring on a second
conflict. He permitted himself, however, to carry this resentment
too far, and lost sight of that subordination to the law
which is the duty of an English sovereign, when he evaded
compliance with this resolution of the Commons, and took on
himself the unconstitutional responsibility of leaving sealed
orders, when he went to Holland, that 16,000 men should be
kept up, without the knowledge of his ministers, which they as
unconstitutionally obeyed. In the next session a new parliament
having been elected, full of men strongly imbued with
what the courtiers styled commonwealth principles, or an
extreme jealousy of royal power,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
 it was found impossible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
resist a diminution of the army to 7000 troops.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
 These too
were voted to be natives of the British dominions; and the
king incurred the severest mortification of his reign, in the
necessity of sending back his regiments of Dutch guards and
French refugees. The messages that passed between him and
the parliament bear witness how deeply he felt, and how fruitlessly
he deprecated, this act of unkindness and ingratitude, so
strikingly in contrast with the deference that parliament has
generally shown to the honours and prejudices of the Crown in
matters of far higher moment.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
 The foreign troops were too
numerous, and it would have been politic to conciliate the
nationality of the multitude by reducing their number; yet
they had claims which a grateful and generous people should not
have forgotten: they were, many of them, the chivalry of
protestantism, the Huguenot gentlemen who had lost all but
their swords in a cause which we deemed our own; they were
the men who had terrified James from Whitehall, and brought
about a deliverance, which, to speak plainly, we had neither
sense nor courage to achieve for ourselves, or which at least we
could never have achieved without enduring the convulsive
throes of anarchy.</p>

<p><i>Irish forfeitures resumed.</i>&mdash;There is, if not mere apology for the
conduct of the Commons, yet more to censure on the king's side,
in another scene of humiliation which he passed through, in the
business of the Irish forfeitures. These confiscations of the
property of those who had fought on the side of James, though,
in a legal sense, at the Crown's disposal, ought undoubtedly to
have been applied to the public service. It was the intention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
parliament that two-thirds at least of these estates should be
sold for that purpose; and William had, in answer to an address
(Jan. 1690) promised to make no grant of them till the matter
should be considered in the ensuing session. Several bills were
brought in to carry the original resolutions into effect, but,
probably through the influence of government, they always fell
to the ground in one or other house of parliament. Meanwhile
the king granted away the whole of these forfeitures, about a
million of acres, with a culpable profuseness, to the enriching of
his personal favourites, such as the Earl of Portland and the
Countess of Orkney.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
 Yet as this had been done in the exercise
of a lawful prerogative, it is not easy to justify the act of resumption
passed in 1699. The precedents for resumption of
grants were obsolete, and from bad times. It was agreed on all
hands that the royal domain is not inalienable; if this were a
mischief, as could not perhaps be doubted, it was one that the
legislature had permitted with open eyes till there was nothing
left to be alienated. Acts therefore of this kind shake the general
stability of possession, and destroy that confidence in which the
practical sense of freedom consists, that the absolute power of
the legislature, which in strictness is as arbitrary in England as
in Persia, will be exercised in consistency with justice and lenity.
They are also accompanied for the most part, as appears to
have been the case in this instance of the Irish forfeitures, with
partiality and misrepresentation as well as violence, and seldom
fail to excite an odium far more than commensurate to the
transient popularity which attends them at the outset.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>But, even if the resumption of William's Irish grants could
be reckoned defensible, there can be no doubt that the mode
adopted by the Commons, of tacking, as it was called, the provisions
for this purpose to a money bill, so as to render it impossible
for the Lords even to modify them without depriving
the king of his supply, tended to subvert the constitution and
annihilate the rights of a co-equal house of parliament. This
most reprehensible device, though not an unnatural consequence
of their pretended right to an exclusive concern in money bills,
had been employed in a former instance during this reign.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>

They were again successful on this occasion; the Lords receded
from their amendments, and passed the bill at the king's desire,
who perceived that the fury of the Commons was tending to a
terrible convulsion.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
 But the precedent was infinitely dangerous
to their legislative power. If the Commons, after some more
attempts of the same nature, desisted from so unjust an encroachment,
it must be attributed to that which has been the
great preservative of the equilibrium in our government, the
public voice of a reflecting people, averse to manifest innovation,
and soon offended by the intemperance of factions.</p>

<p><i>Parliamentary enquiries.</i>&mdash;The essential change which the fall
of the old dynasty had wrought in our constitution displayed
itself in such a vigorous spirit of enquiry and interference of
parliament with all the course of government as, if not absolutely
new, was more uncontested and more effectual than before the
revolution. The Commons indeed under Charles II. had not
wholly lost sight of the precedents which the long parliament
had established for them; but not without continual resistance
from the court, in which their right of examination was by no
means admitted. But the tories throughout the reign of
William evinced a departure from the ancient principles of their
faction in nothing more than in asserting to the fullest extent
the powers and privileges of the Commons; and, in the coalition
they formed with the malcontent whigs, if the men of liberty
adopted the nickname of the men of prerogative, the latter did
not less take up the maxims and feelings of the former. The
bad success and suspected management of public affairs co-operated
with the strong spirit of party to establish this important
accession of authority to the House of Commons. In
June 1689, a special committee was appointed to enquire into
the miscarriages of the war in Ireland, especially as to the delay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in relieving Londonderry. A similar committee was appointed
in the Lords. The former reported severely against Colonel
Lundy, governor of that city; and the house addressed the king,
that he might be sent over to be tried for the treasons laid to his
charge.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
 I do not think there is any earlier precedent in the
Journals for so specific an enquiry into the conduct of a public
officer, especially one in military command. It marks therefore
very distinctly the change of spirit which I have so frequently
mentioned. No courtier has ever since ventured to deny this
general right of enquiry, though it is the constant practice to
elude it. The right to enquire draws with it the necessary
means, the examination of witnesses, records, papers, enforced
by the strong arm of parliamentary privilege. In one respect
alone these powers have fallen rather short; the Commons do
not administer an oath; and having neglected to claim this
authority in the irregular times when they could make a privilege
by a vote, they would now perhaps find difficulty in obtaining
it by consent of the house of peers. They renewed this committee
for enquiring into the miscarriages of the war in the next
session.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
 They went very fully into the dispute between the
board of admiralty and Admiral Russell, after the battle of
La Hogue;<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
 and the year after investigated the conduct of his
successors, Killigrew and Delaval, in the command of the
Channel Fleet.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
 They went, in the winter of 1694, into a very
long examination of the admirals and the orders issued by the
admiralty during the preceding year; and then voted that the
sending the fleet to the Mediterranean, and the continuing it
there this winter, has been to the honour and interest of his
majesty, and his kingdoms.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
 But it is hardly worth while to
enumerate later instances of exercising a right which had become
indisputable, and, even before it rested on the basis of precedent,
could not reasonably be denied to those who might advise,
remonstrate, and impeach.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that, after such important acquisitions of
power, the natural spirit of encroachment, or the desire to
distress a hostile government, should have led to endeavours,
which by their success would have drawn the executive administration
more directly into the hands of parliament. A
proposition was made by some peers, in December 1692, for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
committee of both houses to consider of the present state of the
nation, and what advice should be given to the king concerning
it. This dangerous project was lost by 48 to 36, several tories
and dissatisfied whigs uniting in a protest against its rejection.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>

The king had in his speech to parliament requested their advice
in the most general terms; and this slight expression, though
no more than is contained in the common writ of summons, was
tortured into a pretext for so extraordinary a proposal as that
of a committee of delegates, or council of state, which might
soon have grasped the entire administration. It was at least a
remedy so little according to precedent, or the analogy of our
constitution, that some very serious cause of dissatisfaction
with the conduct of affairs could be its only excuse.</p>

<p>Burnet has spoken with reprobation of another scheme engendered
by the same spirit of enquiry and control, that of a
council of trade, to be nominated by parliament, with powers
for the effectual preservation of the interests of the merchants.
If the members of it were intended to be immovable, or if the
vacancies were to be filled by consent of parliament, this would
indeed have encroached on the prerogative in a far more eminent
degree than the famous India bill of 1783, because its operation
would have been more extensive and more at home. And, even
if they were only named in the first instance, as has been usual
in parliamentary commissioners of account or enquiry, it would
still be material to ask, what extent of power for the preservation
of trade was to be placed in their hands. The precise nature
of the scheme is not explained by Burnet. But it appears by
the Journals that this council was to receive information from
merchants as to the necessity of convoys, and send directions
to the board of admiralty, subject to the king's control, to receive
complaints and represent the same to the king, and in many other
respects to exercise very important and anomalous functions.
They were not however to be members of the house. But even
with this restriction, it was too hazardous a departure from the
general maxims of the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Treaties of partition.</i>&mdash;The general unpopularity of William's
administration, and more particularly the reduction of the
forces, afford an ample justification for the two treaties of
partition which the tory faction, with scandalous injustice and
inconsistency, turned to his reproach. No one could deny that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the aggrandisement of France by both of these treaties was of
serious consequence. But, according to English interests, the
first object was to secure the Spanish Netherlands from becoming
provinces of that power; and next to maintain the real independence
of Spain and the Indies. Italy was but the last in
order; and though the possession of Naples and Sicily, with the
ports of Tuscany, as stipulated in the treaty of partition, would
have rendered France absolute mistress of that whole country
and of the Mediterranean sea, and essentially changed the
balance of Europe, it was yet more tolerable than the acquisition
of the whole monarchy in the name of a Bourbon prince, which
the opening of the succession without previous arrangement
was likely to produce. They at least who shrunk from the
thought of another war, and studiously depreciated the value
of continental alliances, were the last who ought to have exclaimed
against a treaty which had been ratified as the sole
means of giving us something like security, without the cost of
fighting for it. Nothing therefore could be more unreasonable
than the clamour of a tory House of Commons in 1701 (for the
malcontent whigs were now so consolidated with the tories as
in general to bear their name) against the partition treaties;
nothing more unfair than the impeachment of the four lords,
Portland, Orford, Somers, and Halifax, on that account. But
we must at the same time remark, that it is more easy to vindicate
the partition treaties themselves, than to reconcile the
conduct of the king and of some others with the principles
established in our constitution. William had taken these
important negotiations wholly into his own hands, not even
communicating them to any of his English ministers, except
Lord Jersey, until his resolution was finally settled. Lord
Somers, as chancellor, had put the great seal to blank powers,
as a legal authority to the negotiators; which evidently could
not be valid, unless on the dangerous principle that the seal is
conclusive against all exception.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
 He had also sealed the ratification
of the treaty, though not consulted upon it, and though
he seems to have had objections to some of the terms; and in
both instances he set up the king's command as a sufficient
defence. The exclusion of all those whom, whether called privy
or cabinet counsellors, the nation holds responsible for its safety,
from this great negotiation, tended to throw back the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
executive government into the single will of the sovereign, and
ought to have exasperated the House of Commons far more than
the actual treaties of partition, which may probably have been
the safest choice in a most perilous condition of Europe. The
impeachments however were in most respects so ill substantiated
by proof, that they have generally been reckoned a disgraceful
instance of party spirit.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Improvements in constitution under William.</i>&mdash;The whigs, such
of them at least as continued to hold that name in honour, soon
forgave the mistakes and failings of their great deliverer; and
indeed a high regard for the memory of William III. may justly
be reckoned one of the tests by which genuine whiggism, as
opposed both to tory and republican principles, has always been
recognised. By the opposite party he was rancorously hated;
and their malignant calumnies still sully the stream of history.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>

Let us leave such as prefer Charles I. to William III. in the
enjoyment of prejudices which are not likely to be overcome
by argument. But it must ever be an honour to the English
Crown that it has been worn by so great a man. Compared
with him, the statesmen who surrounded his throne, the Sunderlands,
Godolphins, and Shrewsburys, even the Somerses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Montagues, sink into insignificance. He was, in truth, too
great, not for the times wherein he was called to action, but for
the peculiar condition of a king of England after the revolution;
and as he was the last sovereign of this country, whose understanding
and energy of character have been very distinguished,
so was he the last who has encountered the resistance of his
parliament, or stood apart and undisguised in the maintenance
of his own prerogative. His reign is no doubt one of the most
important in our constitutional history, both on account of its
general character, which I have slightly sketched, and of those
beneficial alterations in our law to which it gave rise. These
now call for our attention.</p>

<p><i>Bill for triennial parliaments.</i>&mdash;The enormous duration of
seventeen years, for which Charles II. protracted his second
parliament, turned the thoughts of all who desired improvements
in the constitution towards some limitation on a prerogative
which had not hitherto been thus abused. Not only the
continuance of the same House of Commons during such a
period destroyed the connection between the people and their
representatives, and laid open the latter, without responsibility,
to the corruption which was hardly denied to prevail; but the
privilege of exemption from civil process made needy and
worthless men secure against their creditors, and desirous of a
seat in parliament as a complete safeguard to fraud and injustice.
The term of three years appeared sufficient to establish
a control of the electoral over the representative body,
without recurring to the ancient but inconvenient scheme of
annual parliaments, which men enamoured of a still more
popular form of government than our own were eager to recommend.
A bill for this purpose was brought into the House of
Lords in December 1689, but lost by the prorogation.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
 It
passed both houses early in 1693, the whigs generally supporting,
and the tories opposing it; but on this, as on many other
great questions of this reign, the two parties were not so regularly
arrayed against each other as on points of a more personal
nature.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
 To this bill the king refused his assent: an exercise
of prerogative which no ordinary circumstances can reconcile
either with prudence or with a constitutional administration of
government. But the Commons, as it was easy to foresee, did
not abandon so important a measure; a similar bill received
the royal assent in November 1694.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
 By the triennial bill it
was simply provided that every parliament should cease and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
determine within three years from its meeting. The clause
contained in the act of Charles II. against the intermission of
parliaments for more than three years is repeated; but it was
not thought necessary to revive the somewhat violent and perhaps
impracticable provisions by which the act of 1641 had
secured their meeting; it being evident that even annual sessions
might now be relied upon as indispensable to the machine of
government.</p>

<p>This annual assembly of parliament was rendered necessary,
in the first place, by the strict appropriation of the revenue
according to votes of supply. It was secured next, by passing
the mutiny bill, under which the army is held together, and
subjected to military discipline, for a short term, seldom or
never exceeding twelve months. These are the two effectual
securities against military power; that no pay can be issued to
the troops without a previous authorisation by the Commons
in a committee of supply, and by both houses in an act of appropriation;
and that no officer or soldier can be punished for
disobedience, nor any court martial held, without the annual
re-enactment of the mutiny bill. Thus it is strictly true that, if
the king were not to summon parliament every year, his army
would cease to have a legal existence; and the refusal of either
house to concur in the mutiny bill would at once wrest the
sword out of his grasp. By the bill of rights, it is declared
unlawful to keep any forces in time of peace without consent
of parliament. This consent, by an invariable and wholesome
usage, is given only from year to year; and its necessity may
be considered perhaps the most powerful of those causes which
have transferred so much even of the executive power into the
management of the two houses of parliament.</p>

<p><i>Law of treason.</i>&mdash;The reign of William is also distinguished by
the provisions introduced into our law for the security of the
subject against iniquitous condemnations on the charge of high
treason, and intended to perfect those of earlier times, which
had proved insufficient against the partiality of judges. But
upon this occasion it will be necessary to take up the history of
our constitutional law on this important head from the beginning.</p>

<p>In the earlier ages of our law, the crime of high treason appears
to have been of a vague and indefinite nature, determined only
by such arbitrary construction as the circumstances of each
particular case might suggest. It was held treason to kill the
king's father or his uncle; and Mortimer was attainted for
accroaching, as it was called, royal power; that is, for keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the administration in his own hands, though without violence
towards the reigning prince. But no people can enjoy a free
constitution, unless an adequate security is furnished by their
laws against this discretion of judges in a matter so closely
connected with the mutual relation between the government
and its subjects. A petition was accordingly presented to
Edward III. by one of the best parliaments that ever sat,
requesting that "whereas the king's justices in different counties
adjudge men indicted before them to be traitors for divers
matters not known by the Commons to be treasonable, the king
would, by his council, and the nobles and learned men (les
grands et sages) of the land, declare in parliament what should
be held for treason." The answer to this petition is in the words
of the existing statute, which, as it is by no means so prolix as
it is important, I shall place before the reader's eyes.</p>

<p><i>Statute of Edward III.</i>&mdash;"Whereas divers opinions have been
before this time in what case treason shall be said, and in what
not; the king, at the request of the Lords and Commons, hath
made a declaration in the manner as hereafter followeth; that
is to say, when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our
lord the king, of my lady his queen, or of their eldest son and
heir: or if a man do violate the king's companion or the king's
eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the king's eldest son
and heir: or if a man do levy war against our lord the king in
his realm, or be adherent to the king's enemies in his realm,
giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere, and
thereof be provably attainted of open deed by people of their
condition; and if a man counterfeit the king's great or privy
seal, or his money; and if a man bring false money into this
realm, counterfeit to the money of England, as the money called
Lusheburg, or other like to the said money of England, knowing
the money to be false, to merchandise or make payment in
deceipt of our said lord the king and of his people; and if a
man slay the chancellor, treasurer, or the king's justices of the
one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assize,
and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in
their place doing their offices; and it is to be understood, that
in the cases above rehearsed, it ought to be judged treason
which extends to our lord the king and his royal majesty. And
of such treason the forfeiture of the escheats pertaineth to our
lord the king, as well as the lands and tenements holden of others
as of himself."<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p><i>Its constructive interpretation.</i>&mdash;It seems impossible not to
observe that the want of distinct arrangement natural to so
unphilosophical an age, and which renders many of our old
statutes very confused, is eminently displayed in this strange
conjunction of offences; where to counterfeit the king's seal,
which might be for the sake of private fraud, and even his coin,
which must be so, is ranged along with all that really endangers
the established government, with conspiracy and insurrection.
But this is an objection of little magnitude, compared with one
that arises out of an omission in enumerating the modes whereby
treason could be committed. In most other offences, the intention,
however manifest, the contrivance, however deliberate,
the attempt, however casually rendered abortive, form so many
degrees of malignity, or at least of mischief, which the jurisprudence
of most countries, and none more than England,
formerly, has been accustomed to distinguish from the perpetrated
action by awarding an inferior punishment, or even
none at all. Nor is this distinction merely founded on a difference
in the moral indignation with which we are impelled to regard
an inchoate and a consummate crime, but is warranted by a
principle of reason, since the penalties attached to the completed
offence spread their terror over all the machinations preparatory
to it; and he who fails in his stroke has had the murderer's fate
as much before his eyes as the more dexterous assassin. But
those who conspire against the constituted government connect
in their sanguine hope the assurance of impunity with the
execution of their crime, and would justly deride the mockery
of an accusation which could only be preferred against them
when their banners were unfurled, and their force arrayed. It
is as reasonable, therefore, as it is conformable to the usages of
every country, to place conspiracies against the sovereign power
upon the footing of actual rebellion, and to crush those by the
penalties of treason, who, were the law to wait for their opportunity,
might silence or pervert the law itself. Yet in this
famous statute we find it only declared treasonable to compass
or imagine the king's death; while no project of rebellion
appears to fall within the letter of its enactments, unless it
ripen into a substantive act of levying war.</p>

<p>We may be, perhaps, less inclined to attribute this material
omission to the laxity which has been already remarked to be
usual in our older laws, than to apprehensions entertained by
the barons that, if a mere design to levy war should be rendered
treasonable, they might be exposed to much false testimony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
and arbitrary construction. But strained constructions of this
very statute, if such were their aim, they did not prevent.
Without adverting to the more extravagant convictions under
this statute in some violent reigns, it gradually became an
established doctrine with lawyers, that a conspiracy to levy war
against the king's person, though not in itself a distinct treason,
may be given in evidence as an overt act of compassing his
death. Great as the authorities may be on which this depends,
and reasonable as it surely is that such offences should be
brought within the pale of high treason, yet it is almost necessary
to confess that this doctrine appears utterly irreconcilable with
any fair interpretation of the statute. It has indeed, by some,
been chiefly confined to cases where the attempt meditated is
directly against the king's person, for the purpose of deposing
him, or of compelling him, while under actual duress, to a change
of measures; and this was construed into a compassing of his
death, since any such violence must endanger his life, and
because, as has been said, the prisons and graves of princes are
not very distant.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
 But it seems not very reasonable to found a
capital conviction on such a sententious remark; nor is it by
any means true that a design against a king's life is necessarily
to be inferred from the attempt to get possession of his person.
So far indeed is this from being a general rule, that in a multitude
of instances, especially during the minority or imbecility of a
king, the purposes of conspirators would be wholly defeated by
the death of the sovereign whose name they designed to employ.
But there is still less pretext for applying the same construction
to schemes of insurrection, when the royal person is not directly
the object of attack, and where no circumstance indicates any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
hostile intention towards his safety. This ample extention of
so penal a statute was first given, if I am not mistaken, by the
judges in 1663, on occasion of a meeting by some persons at
Farley Wood in Yorkshire,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
 in order to concert measures for a
rising. But it was afterwards confirmed in Harding's case,
immediately after the revolution, and has been repeatedly laid
down from the bench in subsequent proceedings for treason,
as well as in treatises of very great authority.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
 It has therefore
all the weight of established precedent; yet I question whether
another instance can be found in our jurisprudence of giving so
large a construction, not only to a penal but to any other
statute.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
 Nor does it speak in favour of this construction,
that temporary laws have been enacted on various occasions to
render a conspiracy to levy war treasonable; for which purpose,
according to this current doctrine, the statute of Edward III.
needed no supplemental provision. Such acts were passed under
Elizabeth, Charles II., and George III., each of them limited to
the existing reign.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
 But it is very seldom that, in an hereditary
monarchy, the reigning prince ought to be secured by any
peculiar provisions; and though the remarkable circumstances
of Elizabeth's situation exposed her government to unusual
perils, there seems an air of adulation or absurdity in the two
latter instances. Finally, the act of 57 G. 3, c. 6, has confirmed,
if not extended, what stood on rather a precarious basis, and
rendered perpetual that of 36 G. 3, c. 7, which enacts, "that,
if any person or persons whatsoever, during the life of the king,
and until the end of the next session of parliament after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
demise of the Crown, shall, within the realm or without, compass,
imagine, invent, devise, or intend death or destruction, or any
bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim or wounding,
imprisonment or restraint of the person of the same our sovereign
lord the king, his heirs and successors, or to deprive or depose
him or them from the style, honour, or kingly name of the
imperial crown of this realm, or of any other of his majesty's
dominions or countries, or to levy war against his majesty, his
heirs and successors, within this realm, in order, by force or
constraint, to compel him or them to change his or their
measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint
upon, or to intimidate or overawe, both houses, or either house
of parliament, or to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with
force to invade this realm, or any other his majesty's dominions
or countries under the obeisance of his majesty, his heirs and
successors; and such compassings, imaginations, inventions,
devices, and intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or
declare, by publishing any printing or writing, or by any overt
act or deed; being legally convicted thereof upon the oaths of
two lawful and credible witnesses, shall be adjudged a traitor,
and suffer as in cases of high treason."</p>

<p>This from henceforth will become our standard of constitutional
law, instead of the statute of Edward III., the latterly
received interpretations of which it sanctions and embodies.
But it is to be noted as the doctrine of our most approved
authorities, that a conspiracy for many purposes which, if
carried into effect, would incur the guilt of treason, will not of
itself amount to it. The constructive interpretation of compassing
the king's death appears only applicable to conspiracies,
whereof the intent is to depose or to use personal compulsion
towards him, or to usurp the administration of his government.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>

But though insurrections in order to throw down all enclosures,
to alter the established law or change religion, or in general for
the reformation of alleged grievances of a public nature, wherein
the insurgents have no special interest, are in themselves
treasonable, yet the previous concert and conspiracy for such
purpose could, under the statute of Edward III., only pass for
a misdemeanour. Hence, while it has been positively laid down,
that an attempt by intimidation and violence to force the repeal
of a law is high treason,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
 though directed rather against the
two houses of parliament than the king's person, the judges did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
not venture to declare that a mere conspiracy and consultation
to raise a force for that purpose would amount to that offence.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>

But the statutes of 36 &amp; 57 Geo. 3 determine the intention to
levy war, in order to put any force upon or to intimidate either
house of parliament, manifested by any overt act, to be treason,
and so far have undoubtedly extended the scope of the law.
We may hope that so ample a legislative declaration on the law
of treason will put an end to the preposterous interpretations
which have found too much countenance on some not very
distant occasions. The crime of compassing and imagining the
king's death must be manifested by some overt act; that is,
there must be something done in execution of a traitorous
purpose. For as no hatred towards the person of the sovereign,
nor any longings for his death, are the imagination which the
law here intends, it seems to follow that loose words or writings,
in which such hostile feelings may be embodied, unconnected
with any positive design, cannot amount to treason. It is now
therefore generally agreed, that no words will constitute that
offence, unless as evidence of some overt act of treason; and
the same appears clearly to be the case with respect at least to
unpublished writings.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
</p>

<p>The second clause of the statute, or that which declares the
levying of war against the king within the realm to be treason,
has given rise, in some instances, to constructions hardly less
strained than those upon compassing his death. It would
indeed be a very narrow interpretation, as little required by
the letter as warranted by the reason of this law, to limit the
expression of levying war to rebellions, whereof the deposition
of the sovereign, or subversion of his government, should be
the deliberate object. Force, unlawfully directed against the
supreme authority, constitutes this offence; nor could it have
been admitted as an excuse for the wild attempt of the Earl of
Essex, on this charge of levying war, that his aim was not to
injure the queen's person, but to drive his adversaries from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
presence. The only questions as to this kind of treason are;
first, what shall be understood by force? and secondly, where
it shall be construed to be directed against the government?
And the solution of both these, upon consistent principles, must
so much depend on the circumstances which vary the character
of almost every case, that it seems natural to distrust the general
maxims that have been delivered by lawyers. Many decisions
in cases of treason before the revolution were made by men so
servile and corrupt, they violate so grossly all natural right and
all reasonable interpretation of law, that it has generally been
accounted among the most important benefits of that event to
have restored a purer administration of criminal justice. But,
though the memory of those who pronounced these decisions
is stigmatised, their authority, so far from being abrogated, has
influenced later and better men; and it is rather an unfortunate
circumstance, that precedents which, from the character of the
times when they occurred, would lose at present all respect,
having been transfused into text-books, and formed perhaps
the sole basis of subsequent decisions, are still in not a few
points the invisible foundation of our law. No lawyer, I conceive,
prosecuting for high treason in this age, would rely on
the case of the Duke of Norfolk under Elizabeth, or that of
Williams under James I., or that of Benstead under Charles I.;
but he would certainly not fail to dwell on the authorities of
Sir Edward Coke and Sir Matthew Hale. Yet these eminent
men, and especially the latter, aware that our law is mainly
built on adjudged precedent, and not daring to reject that which
they would not have themselves asserted, will be found to have
rather timidly exercised their judgment in the construction of
this statute, yielding a deference to former authority which we
have transferred to their own.</p>

<p>These observations are particularly applicable to that class
of cases so repugnant to the general understanding of mankind,
and, I believe, of most lawyers, wherein trifling insurrections
for the purpose of destroying brothels or meeting-houses have
been held treasonable under the clause of levying war. Nor
does there seem any ground for the defence which has been
made for this construction, by taking a distinction, that although
a rising to effect a partial end by force is only a riot, yet where
a general purpose of the kind is in view it becomes rebellion;
and thus, though to pull down the enclosures in a single manor
be not treason against the king, yet to destroy all enclosures
throughout the kingdom would be an infringement of his sovereign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
power. For, however solid this distinction may be, yet
in the class of cases to which I allude, this general purpose was
neither attempted to be made out in evidence, nor rendered
probable by the circumstances; nor was the distinction ever
taken upon the several trials. A few apprentices rose in London
in the reign of Charles II., and destroyed some brothels.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
 A
mob of watermen and others, at the time of Sacheverell's
impeachment, set on fire several dissenting meeting-houses.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>

Everything like a formal attack on the established government
is so much excluded in these instances by the very nature of
the offence and the means of the offenders, that it is impossible
to withhold our reprobation from the original decision, upon
which, with too much respect for unreasonable and unjust
authority, the later cases have been established. These indeed
still continue to be cited as law; but it is much to be doubted
whether a conviction for treason will ever again be obtained,
or even sought for, under similar circumstances. One reason
indeed for this, were there no weight in any other, might suffice;
the punishment of tumultuous risings, attended with violence,
has been rendered capital by the riot act of George I. and other
statutes; so that, in the present state of the law, it is generally
more advantageous for the government to treat such an offence
as felony than as treason.</p>

<p><i>Statute of William III.</i>&mdash;It might for a moment be doubted,
upon the statute of Edward VI., whether the two witnesses
whom the act requires must not depose to the same overt acts
of treason. But, as this would give an undue security to conspirators,
so it is not necessarily implied by the expression;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
nor would it be indeed the most unwarrantable latitude that
has been given to this branch of penal law, to maintain that
two witnesses to any distinct acts comprised in the same indictment
would satisfy the letter of this enactment. But a more
wholesome distinction appears to have been taken before the
revolution, and is established by the statute of William, that,
although different overt acts may be proved by two witnesses,
they must relate to the same species of treason, so that one
witness to an alleged act of compassing the king's death cannot
be conjoined with another deposing to an act of levying war,
in order to make up the required number.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
 As for the practice
of courts of justice before the restoration, it was so much at
variance with all principles, that few prisoners were allowed the
benefit of this statute;<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
 succeeding judges fortunately deviated
more from their predecessors in the method of conducting trials
than they have thought themselves at liberty to do in laying
down rules of law.</p>

<p>Nothing had brought so much disgrace on the councils of
government and on the administration of justice, nothing had
more forcibly spoken the necessity of a great change than the
prosecutions for treason during the latter years of Charles II.,
and in truth during the whole course of our legal history. The
statutes of Edward III. and Edward VI., almost set aside by
sophistical constructions, required the corroboration of some
more explicit law; and some peculiar securities were demanded
for innocence against that conspiracy of the court with the
prosecutor, which is so much to be dreaded in all trials for
political crimes. Hence the attainders of Russell, Sidney,
Cornish, and Armstrong were reversed by the convention-parliament
without opposition; and men attached to liberty
and justice, whether of the whig or tory name, were anxious to
prevent any future recurrence of those iniquitous proceedings,
by which the popular frenzy at one time, the wickedness of the
court at another, and in each instance with the co-operation of
a servile bench of judges, had sullied the honour of English
justice. A better tone of political sentiment had begun indeed
to prevail, and the spirit of the people must ever be a more
effectual security than the virtue of the judges; yet, even after
the revolution, if no unjust or illegal convictions in cases of
treason can be imputed to our tribunals, there was still not a
little of that rudeness towards the prisoner, and manifestation
of a desire to interpret all things to his prejudice, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
been more grossly displayed by the bench under Charles II.
The jacobites, against whom the law now directed its terrors,
as loudly complained of Treby and Pollexfen, as the whigs had
of Scroggs and Jefferies, and weighed the convictions of Ashton
and Anderton against those of Russell and Sidney.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
</p>

<p>Ashton was a gentleman, who, in company with Lord Preston,
was seized in endeavouring to go over to France with an invitation
from the jacobite party. The contemporary writers on
that side, and some historians who incline to it, have represented
his conviction as grounded upon insufficient, because only upon
presumptive evidence. It is true that in most of our earlier
cases of treason, treasonable facts have been directly proved;
whereas it was left to the jury in that of Ashton, whether they
were satisfied of his acquaintance with the contents of certain
papers taken on his person. There does not however seem to
be any reason why presumptive inferences are to be rejected
in charges of treason, or why they should be drawn with more
hesitation than in other grave offences; and if this be admitted,
there can be no doubt that the evidence against Ashton was
such as is ordinarily reckoned conclusive. It is stronger than
that offered for the prosecution against O'Quigley at Maidstone
in 1798, a case of the closest resemblance; and yet I am not
aware that the verdict in that instance was thought open to
censure. No judge however in modern times would question,
much less reply upon, the prisoner, as to material points of his
defence, as Holt and Pollexfen did in this trial; the practice
of a neighbouring kingdom, which, in our more advanced sense
of equity and candour, we are agreed to condemn.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
</p>

<p>It is perhaps less easy to justify the conduct of Chief-Justice
Treby in the trial of Anderton for printing a treasonable pamphlet.
The testimony came very short of satisfactory proof,
according to the established rules of English law, though by no
means such as men in general would slight. It chiefly consisted
of a comparison between the characters of a printed work found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
concealed in his lodgings and certain types belonging to his
press; a comparison manifestly less admissible than that of
handwriting, which is always rejected, and indeed totally inconsistent
with the rigour of English proof. Besides the common
objections made to a comparison of hands, and which apply
more forcibly to printed characters, it is manifest that types
cast in the same font must always be exactly similar. But,
on the other hand, it seems unreasonable absolutely to exclude,
as our courts have done, the comparison of handwriting as
inadmissible evidence; a rule which is every day eluded by
fresh rules, not much more rational in themselves, which have
been invented to get rid of its inconvenience. There seems
however much danger in the construction which draws printed
libels, unconnected with any conspiracy, within the pale of
treason, and especially the treason of compassing the king's
death, unless where they directly tended to his assassination.
No later authority can, as far as I remember, be adduced for
the prosecution of any libel as treasonable, under the statute
of Edward III. But the pamphlet for which Anderton was
convicted was certainly full of the most audacious jacobitism,
and might perhaps fall, by no unfair construction, within the
charge of adhering to the king's enemies; since no one could
be more so than James, whose design of invading the realm had
been frequently avowed by himself.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
</p>

<p>A bill for regulating trials upon charges of high treason
passed the Commons with slight resistance by the Crown
lawyers in 1691.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
 The Lords introduced a provision in their
own favour, that upon the trial of a peer in the court of the high
steward, all such as were entitled to vote should be regularly
summoned; it having been the practice to select twenty-three
at the discretion of the Crown. Those who wished to hinder
the bill availed themselves of the jealousy which the Commons
in that age entertained of the upper house of parliament, and
persuaded them to disagree with this just and reasonable
amendment.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
 It fell to the ground therefore on this occasion;
and though more than once revived in subsequent sessions, the
same difference between the two houses continued to be insuperable.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
In the new parliament that met in 1695, Commons
had the good sense to recede from an irrational jealousy. Notwithstanding
the reluctance of the ministry, for which perhaps
the very dangerous position of the king's government furnishes
an apology, this excellent statute was enacted as an additional
guarantee (in such bad times as might again occur) to those
who are prominent in their country's cause, against the great
danger of false accusers and iniquitous judges.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
 It provides
that all persons indicted for high treason shall have a copy of
their indictment delivered to them five days before their trial,
a period extended by a subsequent act to ten days, and a copy
of the panel of jurors two days before their trial; that they
shall be allowed to have their witnesses examined on oath, and
to make their defence by counsel. It clears up any doubt that
could be pretended on the statute of Edward VI., by requiring
two witnesses, either both to the same overt act, or the first to
one, the second to another overt act of the same treason (that
is, the same kind of treason), unless the party shall voluntarily
confess the charge.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
 It limits prosecutions for treason to the
term of three years, except in the case of an attempted assassination
on the king. It includes the contested provision for
the trial of peers by all who have a right to sit and vote in
parliament. A later statute, 7 Anne, c. 21, which may be
mentioned here as the complement of the former, has added a
peculiar privilege to the accused, hardly less material than any
of the rest. Ten days before the trial, a list of the witnesses
intended to be brought for proving the indictment, with their
professions and place of abode, must be delivered to the prisoner,
along with the copy of the indictment. The operation of this
clause was suspended till after the death of the pretended
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a hasty remark of Burnet, that the design
of this bill seemed to be to make men as safe in all treasonable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
practices as possible, it ought to be considered a valuable
accession to our constitutional law; and no part, I think, of
either statute will be reckoned inexpedient, when we reflect
upon the history of all nations, and more especially of our own.
The history of all nations, and more especially of our own, in
the fresh recollection of those who took a share in these acts,
teaches us that false accusers are always encouraged by a bad
government, and may easily deceive a good one. A prompt
belief in the spies whom they perhaps necessarily employ, in
the voluntary informers who dress up probable falsehoods, is
so natural and constant in the offices of ministers, that the best
are to be heard with suspicion when they bring forward such
testimony. One instance, at least, had occurred since the
revolution, of charges unquestionably false in their specific
details, preferred against men of eminence by impostors who
panted for the laurels of Oates and Turberville.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
 And, as men
who are accused of conspiracy against a government are generally
such as are beyond question disaffected to it, the indiscriminating
temper of the prejudging people, from whom juries
must be taken, is as much to be apprehended, when it happens
to be favourable to authority, as that of the government itself;
and requires as much the best securities, imperfect as the best
are, which prudence and patriotism can furnish to innocence.
That the prisoner's witnesses should be examined on oath will
of course not be disputed, since by a subsequent statute that
strange and unjust anomaly in our criminal law has been
removed in all cases as well as in treason; but the judges had
sometimes not been ashamed to point out to the jury, in derogation
of the credit of those whom a prisoner called in his
behalf, that they were not speaking under the same sanction as
those for the Crown. It was not less reasonable that the defence
should be conducted by counsel; since that excuse which is
often made for denying the assistance of counsel on charges of
felony, namely, the moderation of prosecutors and the humanity
of the bench, could never be urged in those political accusations
wherein the advocates for the prosecution contend with all their
strength for victory; and the impartiality of the court is rather
praised when it is found than relied upon beforehand.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
 Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
does there lie any sufficient objection even to that which many
dislike, the furnishing a list of the witnesses to the prisoner,
when we set on the other side the danger of taking away innocent
lives by the testimony of suborned and infamous men, and
remember also that a guilty person can rarely be ignorant of those
who will bear witness against him; or if he could, that he may
always discover those who have been examined before the grand
jury, and that no others can in any case be called on the trial.</p>

<p>The subtlety of Crown lawyers in drawing indictments for
treason, and the willingness of judges to favour such prosecutions,
have considerably eluded the chief difficulties which the
several statutes appear to throw in their way. The government
has at least had no reason to complain that the construction of
those enactments has been too rigid. The overt acts laid in
the indictment are expressed so generally that they give sometimes
little insight into the particular circumstances to be
adduced in evidence; and, though the act of William is positive
that no evidence shall be given of any overt act not laid in the
indictment, it has been held allowable, and is become the constant
practice, to bring forward such evidence, not as substantive
charges, but on the pretence of its tending to prove
certain other acts specially alleged. The disposition to extend
a constructive interpretation to the statute of Edward III. has
continued to increase; and was carried, especially by Chief-Justice
Eyre in the trials of 1794, to a length at which we lose
sight altogether of the plain meaning of words, and apparently
much beyond what Pemberton, or even Jefferies, had reached.
In the vast mass of circumstantial testimony which our modern
trials for high treason display, it is sometimes difficult to discern
whether the great principle of our law, requiring two witnesses
to overt acts, has been adhered to; for certainly it is not adhered
to, unless such witnesses depose to acts of the prisoner, from
which an inference of his guilt is immediately deducible.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
 There
can be no doubt that state prosecutions have long been conducted
with an urbanity and exterior moderation unknown to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the age of the Stuarts, or even to that of William; but this may
by possibility be compatible with very partial wrestling of the
law, and the substitution of a sort of political reasoning for that
strict interpretation of penal statutes which the subject has a
right to demand. No confidence in the general integrity of a
government, much less in that of its lawyers, least of all any
belief in the guilt of an accused person, should beguile us to
remit that vigilance which is peculiarly required in such circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
</p>

<p>For this vigilance, and indeed for almost all that keeps up in
us, permanently and effectually, the spirit of regard to liberty
and the public good, we must look to the unshackled and independent
energies of the press. In the reign of William III.,
and through the influence of the popular principle in our constitution,
this finally became free. The licensing act, suffered
to expire in 1679, was revived in 1685 for seven years. In 1692,
it was continued till the end of the session of 1693. Several
attempts were afterwards made to renew its operation, which
the less courtly whigs combined with the tories and jacobites
to defeat.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
 Both parties indeed employed the press with great
diligence in this reign; but while one degenerated into malignant
calumny and misrepresentation, the signal victory of liberal
principles is manifestly due to the boldness and eloquence with
which they were promulgated. Even during the existence of
a censorship, a host of unlicensed publications, by the negligence
or connivance of the officers employed to seize them, bore
witness to the inefficacy of its restrictions. The bitterest
invectives of jacobitism were circulated in the first four years
after the revolution.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Liberty of the press.</i>&mdash;The liberty of the press consists, in a
strict sense, merely in an exemption from the superintendence
of a licenser. But it cannot be said to exist in any security,
or sufficiently for its principal ends, where discussions of a
political or religious nature, whether general or particular, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
restrained by too narrow and severe limitations. The law of
libel has always been indefinite; an evil probably beyond any
complete remedy, but which evidently renders the liberty of
free discussion rather more precarious in its exercise than might
be wished. It appears to have been the received doctrine in
Westminster Hall before the revolution, that no man might
publish a writing reflecting on the government, nor upon the
character, or even capacity and fitness, of any one employed in
it. Nothing having passed to change the law, the law remained
as before. Hence in the case of Tutchin, it is laid down by
Holt, that to possess the people with an ill opinion of the government,
that is, of the ministry, is a libel. And the attorney-general,
in his speech for the prosecution, urges that there can
be no reflection on those that are in office under her majesty,
but it must cast some reflection on the queen who employs
them. Yet in this case the censure upon the administration, in
the passages selected for prosecution, was merely general, and
without reference to any person, upon which the counsel for
Tutchin vainly relied.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
</p>

<p>It is manifest that such a doctrine was irreconcilable with
the interests of any party out of power, whose best hope to
regain it is commonly by prepossessing the nation with a bad
opinion of their adversaries. Nor would it have been possible
for any ministry to stop the torrent of a free press, under the
secret guidance of a powerful faction, by a few indictments for
libel. They found it generally more expedient and more agreeable
to borrow weapons from the same armoury, and retaliate
with unsparing invective and calumny. This was first practised
(first, I mean, with the avowed countenance of government) by
Swift in the <i>Examiner</i>, and some of his other writings. And
both parties soon went such lengths in this warfare that it
became tacitly understood that the public characters of statesmen,
and the measures of administration, are the fair topics of
pretty severe attacks. Less than this indeed would not have
contented the political temper of the nation, gradually and
without intermission becoming more democratical, and more
capable, as well as more accustomed, to judge of its general
interests, and of those to whom they were intrusted. The just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
limit between political and private censure has been far better
drawn in these later times, licentious as we still may justly
deem the press, than in an age when courts of justice had not
deigned to acknowledge, as they do at present, its theoretical
liberty. No writer, except of the most broken reputation,
would venture at this day on the malignant calumnies of Swift.</p>

<p><i>Law of libel.</i>&mdash;Meanwhile the judges naturally adhered to
their established doctrine; and, in prosecutions for political
libels, were very little inclined to favour what they deemed
the presumption, if not the licentiousness, of the press. They
advanced a little farther than their predecessors; and, contrary
to the practice both before and after the revolution, laid it down
at length as an absolute principle, that falsehood, though always
alleged in the indictment, was not essential to the guilt of the
libel; refusing to admit its truth to be pleaded, or given in
evidence, or even urged by way of mitigation of punishment.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>

But as the defendant could only be convicted by the verdict of
a jury, and jurors both partook of the general sentiment in
favour of free discussion, and might in certain cases have
acquired some prepossessions as to the real truth of the supposed
libel, which the court's refusal to enter upon it could not
remove, they were often reluctant to find a verdict of guilty;
and hence arose by degrees a sort of contention which sometimes
showed itself upon trials, and divided both the profession of the
law and the general public. The judges and lawyers, for the
most part, maintained that the province of the jury was only
to determine the fact of publication; and also whether what
are called the innuendoes were properly filled up, that is,
whether the libel meant that which it was alleged in the indictment
to mean, not whether such meaning were criminal or
innocent, a question of law which the court were exclusively
competent to decide. That the jury might acquit at their
pleasure was undeniable; but it was asserted that they would
do so in violation of their oaths and duty, if they should reject
the opinion of the judge by whom they were to be guided as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the general law. Others of great name in our jurisprudence,
and the majority of the public at large, conceiving that this
would throw the liberty of the press altogether into the hands
of the judges, maintained that the jury had a strict right to
take the whole matter into their consideration, and determine
the defendant's criminality or innocence according to the nature
and circumstances of the publication. This controversy, which
perhaps hardly arose within the period to which the present
work relates, was settled by Mr. Fox's libel bill in 1792. It
declares the right of the jury to find a general verdict upon the
whole matter; and though, from causes easy to explain, it is
not drawn in the most intelligible and consistent manner, was
certainly designed to turn the defendant's intention, as it might
be laudable or innocent, seditious or malignant, into a matter
of fact for their enquiry and decision.</p>

<p><i>Religious toleration.</i>&mdash;The revolution is justly entitled to
honour as the era of religious, in a far greater degree than of
civil liberty; the privileges of conscience having had no earlier
magna charta and petition of right whereto they could appeal
against encroachment. Civil, indeed, and religious liberty had
appeared, not as twin sisters and co-heirs, but rather in jealous
and selfish rivalry; it was in despite of the law, it was through
infringement of the constitution, by the court's connivance, by
the dispensing prerogative, by the declarations of indulgence
under Charles and James, that some respite had been obtained
from the tyranny which those who proclaimed their attachment
to civil rights had always exercised against one class of
separatists, and frequently against another.</p>

<p>At the time when the test law was enacted, chiefly with a
view against popery, but seriously affecting the protestant nonconformists,
it was the intention of the House of Commons to
afford relief to the latter by relaxing in some measure the
strictness of the act of uniformity in favour of such ministers
as might be induced to conform, by granting an indulgence of
worship to those who should persist in their separation. This
bill however dropped in that session. Several more attempts
at an union were devised by worthy men of both parties in that
reign, but with no success. It was the policy of the court to
withstand a comprehension of dissenters; nor would the bishops
admit of any concession worth the others' acceptance. The
high-church party would not endure any mention of indulgence.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
In the parliament of 1680, a bill to relieve protestant dissenters
from the penalties of the 35th of Elizabeth, the most severe act
in force against them, having passed both houses, was lost off
the table of the House of Lords, at the moment that the king
came to give his assent; an artifice by which he evaded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
odium of an explicit refusal.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
 Meanwhile the nonconforming
ministers, and in many cases their followers, experienced a
harassing persecution under the various penal laws that oppressed
them; the judges, especially in the latter part of this reign,
when some good magistrates were gone, and still more the justices
of the peace, among whom a high-church ardour was prevalent,
crowding the gaols with the pious confessors of puritanism.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>

Under so rigorous an administration of statute law, it was not
unnatural to take the shelter offered by the declaration of
indulgence; but the dissenters never departed from their
ancient abhorrence of popery and arbitrary power, and embraced
the terms of reconciliation and alliance which the church,
in its distress, held out to them. A scheme of comprehension
was framed under the auspices of Archbishop Sancroft before
the revolution. Upon the completion of the new settlement it
was determined, with the apparent concurrence of the church,
to grant an indulgence to separate conventicles, and at the same
time, by enlarging the terms of conformity, to bring back those
whose differences were not irreconcilable within the pale of the
Anglican communion.</p>

<p>The act of toleration was passed with little difficulty, though
not without the murmurs of the bigoted churchmen.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
 It
exempts from the penalties of existing statutes against separate
conventicles, or absence from the established worship, such as
should take the oath of allegiance, and subscribe the declaration
against popery, and such ministers of separate congregations as
should subscribe the thirty-nine articles of the church of England
except three, and part of a fourth. It gives also an indulgence to
quakers without this condition. Meeting-houses are required to
be registered, and are protected from insult by a penalty. No
part of this toleration is extended to papists or to such as deny
the Trinity. We may justly deem this act a very scanty
measure of religious liberty; yet it proved more effectual through
the lenient and liberal policy of the eighteenth century; the
subscription to articles of faith, which soon became as obnoxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
as that to matters of a more indifferent nature, having been
practically dispensed with, though such a genuine toleration as
Christianity and philosophy alike demand, had no place in our
statute-book before the reign of George III.</p>

<p>It was found more impracticable to overcome the prejudices
which stood against any enlargement of the basis of the English
church. The bill of comprehension, though nearly such as had
been intended by the primate, and conformable to the plans so
often in vain devised by the most wise and moderate churchmen,
met with a very cold reception. Those among the clergy who
disliked the new settlement of the Crown (and they were by far
the greater part), played upon the ignorance and apprehensions
of the gentry. The king's suggestion in a speech from the
throne, that means should be found to render all protestants
capable of serving him in Ireland, as it looked towards a repeal
or modification of the test act, gave offence to the zealous churchmen.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>

A clause proposed in the bill for changing the oaths of
supremacy and allegiance, in order to take away the necessity
of receiving the sacrament in the church as a qualification for
office, was rejected by a great majority of the Lords, twelve
whig peers protesting.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
 Though the bill of comprehension proposed
to parliament went no farther than to leave a few scrupled
ceremonies at discretion, and to admit presbyterian ministers
into the church without pronouncing on the invalidity of their
former ordination, it was mutilated in passing through the upper
house; and the Commons, after entertaining it for a time,
substituted an address to the king, that he would call the house
of convocation "to be advised with in ecclesiastical matters."<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>

It was, of course, necessary to follow this recommendation.
But the lower house of convocation, as might be foreseen, threw
every obstacle in the way of the king's enlarged policy. They
chose a man as their prolocutor who had been forward in the
worst conduct of the university of Oxford. They displayed in
everything a factious temper, which held the very names of
concession and conciliation in abhorrence. Meanwhile a commission
of divines, appointed under the great seal, had made a
revision of the liturgy, in order to eradicate everything which
could give a plausible ground of offence, as well as to render the
service more perfect. Those of the high-church faction had
soon seceded from this commission; and its deliberations were
doubtless the more honest and rational for their absence. But,
as the complacence of parliament towards ecclesiastical authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
had shown that no legislative measure could be forced against
the resistance of the lower house of convocation, it was not
thought expedient to lay before that synod of insolent priests
the revised liturgy, which they would have employed as an
engine of calumny against the bishops and the Crown. The
scheme of comprehension, therefore, fell absolutely and finally
to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Schism of the non-jurors.</i>&mdash;A similar relaxation of the terms of
conformity would, in the reign of Elizabeth, or even at the
time of the Savoy conferences, have brought back so large a
majority of dissenters that the separation of the remainder
could not have afforded any colour of alarm to the most jealous
dignitary. Even now it is said that two-thirds of the nonconformists
would have embraced the terms of reunion. But
the motives of dissent were already somewhat changed, and had
come to turn less on the petty scruples of the elder puritans
and on the differences in ecclesiastical discipline, than on a
dislike to all subscriptions of faith and compulsory uniformity.
The dissenting ministers, accustomed to independence, and
finding not unfrequently in the contributions of their disciples
a better maintenance than court favour and private patronage
have left for diligence and piety in the establishment, do not
seem to have much regretted the fate of this measure. None
of their friends, in the most favourable times, have ever made
an attempt to renew it. There are indeed serious reasons why
the boundaries of religious communion should be as widely
extended as is consistent with its end and nature; and among
these the hardship and detriment of excluding conscientious
men from the ministry is not the least. Nor is it less evident
that from time to time, according to the progress of knowledge
and reason, to remove defects and errors from the public service
of the church, even if they have not led to scandal or separation,
is the bounden duty of its governors. But none of these considerations
press much on the minds of statesmen; and it was
not to be expected that any administration should prosecute a
religious reform for its own sake, at the hazard of that tranquillity
and exterior unity which is in general the sole end for
which they would deem such a reform worth attempting. Nor
could it be dissembled that, so long as the endowments of a
national church are supposed to require a sort of politic organisation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
within the commonwealth, and a busy spirit of faction for
their security, it will be convenient for the governors of the state,
whenever they find this spirit adverse to them, as it was at the
revolution, to preserve the strength of the dissenting sects as a
counterpoise to that dangerous influence which, in protestant
churches, as well as that of Rome, has sometimes set up the
interest of one order against that of the community. And
though the church of England made a high vaunt of her loyalty,
yet, as Lord Shrewsbury told William of the tories in general,
he must remember that he was not their king; of which indeed
he had abundant experience.</p>

<p>A still more material reason against any alteration in the
public liturgy and ceremonial religion at that feverish crisis,
unless with a much more decided concurrence of the nation than
could be obtained, was the risk of nourishing the schism of the
non-jurors. These men went off from the church on grounds
merely political, or at most on the pretence that the civil power
was incompetent to deprive bishops of their ecclesiastical jurisdiction;
to which none among the laity, who did not adopt the
same political tenets, were likely to pay attention. But the
established liturgy was, as it is at present, in the eyes of the great
majority, the distinguishing mark of the Anglican church, far
more indeed than episcopal government, whereof so little is
known by the mass of the people that its abolition would make no
perceptible difference in their religion. Any change, though for
the better, would offend those prejudices of education and habit,
which it requires such a revolutionary commotion of the public
mind as the sixteenth century witnessed, to subdue, and might
fill the jacobite conventicles with adherents to the old church.
It was already the policy of the non-juring clergy to hold themselves
up in this respectable light, and to treat the Tillotsons
and Burnets as equally schismatic in discipline and unsound in
theology. Fortunately, however, they fell into the snare which
the established church had avoided; and deviating, at least in
their writings, from the received standard of Anglican orthodoxy,
into what the people saw with most jealousy, a sort of approximation
to the church of Rome, gave their opponents an advantage
in controversy, and drew farther from that part of the
clergy who did not much dislike their political creed. They
were equally injudicious and neglectful of the signs of the times,
when they promulgated such extravagant assertions of sacerdotal
power as could not stand with the regal supremacy, or any subordination
to the state. It was plain, from the writings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Leslie and other leaders of their party, that the mere restoration
of the house of Stuart would not content them, without undoing
all that had been enacted as to the church from the time
of Henry VIII.; and thus the charge of innovation came
evidently home to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
</p>

<p>The convention parliament would have acted a truly politic,
as well as magnanimous, part in extending this boon, or rather
this right, of religious liberty to the members of that unfortunate
church, for whose sake the late king had lost his throne. It
would have displayed to mankind that James had fallen, not
as a catholic, nor for seeking to bestow toleration on catholics,
but as a violator of the constitution. William, in all things
superior to his subjects, knew that temporal, and especially
military fidelity, would be in almost every instance proof against
the seductions of bigotry. The Dutch armies have always been
in a great measure composed of catholics; and many of that
profession served under him in the invasion of England. His
own judgment for the repeal of the penal laws had been declared
even in the reign of James. The danger, if any, was now
immensely diminished; and it appears in the highest degree
probable that a genuine toleration of their worship, with no
condition but the oath of allegiance, would have brought over
the majority of that church to the protestant succession, so far
at least as to engage in no schemes inimical to it. The wiser
catholics would have perceived that, under a king of their own
faith, or but suspected of an attachment to it, they must continue
the objects of perpetual distrust to a protestant nation.
They would have learned that conspiracy and jesuitical intrigue
could but keep alive calumnious imputations, and diminish the
respect which a generous people would naturally pay to their
sincerity and their misfortune. Had the legislators of that age
taken a still larger sweep, and abolished at once those tests and
disabilities, which, once necessary bulwarks against an insidious
court, were no longer demanded in the more republican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
model of our government, the jacobite cause would have
suffered, I believe, a more deadly wound than penal statutes
and double taxation were able to inflict. But this was beyond
the philosophers, how much beyond the statesmen, of the
time!</p>

<p><i>Laws against Roman catholics.</i>&mdash;The tories, in their malignant
hatred of our illustrious monarch, turned his connivance at
popery into a theme of reproach.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
 It was believed, and probably
with truth, that he had made to his catholic allies promises
of relaxing the penal laws; and the jacobite intriguers had the
mortification to find that William had his party at Rome, as
well as her exiled confessor of St. Germains. After the peace
of Ryswick many priests came over, and showed themselves
with such incautious publicity as alarmed the bigotry of the
House of Commons, and produced the disgraceful act of 1700
against the growth of popery.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
 The admitted aim of this
statute was to expel the catholic proprietors of land, comprising
many very ancient and wealthy families, by rendering it necessary
for them to sell their estates. It first offers a reward of £100
to any informer against a priest exercising his functions, and
adjudges the penalty of perpetual imprisonment. It requires
every person educated in the popish religion, or professing the
same, within six months after he shall attain the age of eighteen
years, to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and
subscribe the declaration set down in the act of Charles II.
against transubstantiation and the worship of saints; in default
of which he is incapacitated, not only to purchase, but to inherit
or take lands under any devise or limitation. The next of kin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
being a protestant shall enjoy such lands during his life.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
 So
unjust, so unprovoked a persecution is the disgrace of that parliament.
But the spirit of liberty and tolerance was too strong
for the tyranny of the law; and this statute was not executed
according to its purpose. The catholic land-holders neither
renounced their religion, nor abandoned their inheritances.
The judges put such constructions upon the clause of forfeiture
as eluded its efficacy; and, I believe, there were scarce any
instances of a loss of property under this law. It has been said,
and I doubt not with justice, that the catholic gentry, during
the greater part of the eighteenth century, were as a separated
and half proscribed class among their equals, their civil exclusion
hanging over them in the intercourse of general society;<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
 but
their notorious, though not unnatural, disaffection to the reigning
family will account for much of this, and their religion was
undoubtedly exercised with little disguise or apprehension. The
laws were perhaps not much less severe and sanguinary than
those which oppressed the protestants of France; but, in their
actual administration, what a contrast between the government
of George II. and Louis XV., between the gentleness of an
English court of king's bench, and the ferocity of the parliaments
of Aix and Thoulouse!</p>

<p><i>Act of settlement.</i>&mdash;The immediate settlement of the Crown at
the revolution extended only to the descendants of Anne and
of William. The former was at that time pregnant, and became
in a few months the mother of a son. Nothing therefore urged
the convention-parliament to go any farther in limiting the
succession. But the king, in order to secure the elector of
Hanover to the grand alliance, was desirous to settle the reversion
of the Crown on his wife the Princess Sophia and her
posterity. A provision to this effect was inserted in the bill of
rights by the House of Lords. But the Commons rejected the
amendment with little opposition; not, as Burnet idly insinuates
through the secret wish of a republican party (which never
existed, or had no influence) to let the monarchy die a natural
death, but from a just sense that the provision was unnecessary
and might become inexpedient.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
 During the life of the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Duke of Gloucester the course of succession appeared clear.
But upon his untimely death in 1700, the manifest improbability
that the limitations already established could subsist beyond
the lives of the king and Princess of Denmark made it highly
convenient to preclude intrigue, and cut off the hopes of the
jacobites, by a new settlement of the Crown on a protestant line
of princes. Though the choice was truly free in the hands of
parliament, and no pretext of absolute right could be advanced
on any side, there was no question that the Princess Sophia was
the fittest object of the nation's preference. She was indeed
very far removed from any hereditary title. Besides the pretended
Prince of Wales, and his sister, whose legitimacy no one
disputed, there stood in her way the Duchess of Savoy, daughter
of Henrietta Duchess of Orleans, and several of the Palatine
family. These last had abjured the reformed faith, of which
their ancestors had been the strenuous assertors; but it seemed
not improbable that some one might return to it; and, if all
hereditary right of the ancient English royal line, the descendant
of Henry VII., had not been extinguished, it would have been
necessary to secure the succession of any prince, who should
profess the protestant religion at the time when the existing
limitations should come to an end. Nor indeed, on the supposition
that the next heir had a right to enjoy the Crown, would the
act of settlement have been required.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
 According to the tenor
and intention of this statute, all prior claims of inheritance, save
that of the issue of King William and the Princess Anne, being
set aside and annulled, the Princess Sophia became the source of
a new royal line. The throne of England and Ireland, by virtue
of the paramount will of parliament, stands entailed upon the
heirs of her body, being protestants. In them the right is as
truly hereditary as it ever was in the Plantagenets or the Tudors.
But they derive it not from those ancient families. The blood
indeed of Cerdic and of the Conqueror flows in the veins of
his present majesty. Our Edwards and Henries illustrate the
almost unrivalled splendour and antiquity of the house of
Brunswick. But they have transmitted no more right to the
allegiance of England than Boniface of Este or Henry the Lion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
That rests wholly on the act of settlement, and resolves itself
into the sovereignty of the legislature. We have therefore an
abundant security that no prince of the house of Brunswick
will ever countenance the silly theories of imprescriptible right,
which flattery and superstition seem still to render current in
other countries. He would brand his own brow with the names
of upstart and usurper. For the history of the revolution, and of
that change in the succession which ensued upon it, will for ages
to come be fresh and familiar as the recollections of yesterday.
And if the people's choice be, as surely it is, the primary foundation
of magistracy, it is perhaps more honourable to be nearer
the source than to deduce a title from some obscure chieftain,
through a long roll of tyrants and idiots.</p>

<p>The majority of that House of Commons which passed the
bill of settlement consisted of those who having long opposed
the administration of William, though with very different principles
both as to the succession of the Crown and its prerogative,
were now often called by the general name of tories. Some,
no doubt, of these were adverse to a measure which precluded
the restoration of the house of Stuart, even on the contingency
that its heir might embrace the protestant religion. But this
party could not show itself very openly; and Harley, the new
leader of the tories, zealously supported the entail of the Crown
on the Princess Sophia. But it was determined to accompany
this settlement with additional securities for the subject's
liberty. The bill of rights was reckoned hasty and defective;
some matters of great importance had been omitted, and in the
twelve years which had since elapsed, new abuses had called
for new remedies. Eight articles were therefore inserted in the
act of settlement, to take effect only from the commencement
of the new limitation to the house of Hanover. Some of them,
as will appear, sprung from a natural jealousy of this unknown
and foreign line; some should strictly not have been postponed
so long; but it is necessary to be content with what it is practicable
to obtain. These articles are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>That whosoever shall hereafter come to the possession of
this Crown, shall join in communion with the church of England
as by law established.</p>

<p>That in case the Crown and imperial dignity of this realm
shall hereafter come to any person, not being a native of this
kingdom of England, this nation be not obliged to engage in any
war for the defence of any dominions or territories which do not
belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of parliament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>That no person who shall hereafter come to the possession of
this Crown, shall go out of the dominions of England, Scotland,
or Ireland, without consent of parliament.</p>

<p>That from and after the time that the further limitation by
this act shall take effect, all matters and things relating to the
well governing of this kingdom, which are properly cognisable
in the privy council by the laws and customs of this realm, shall
be transacted there, and all resolutions taken thereupon shall
be signed by such of the privy council as shall advise and consent
to the same.</p>

<p>That, after the said limitation shall take effect as aforesaid,
no person born out of the kingdoms of England, Scotland, or
Ireland, or the dominions thereunto belonging (although he be
naturalised or made a denizen&mdash;except such as are born of
English parents), shall be capable to be of the privy council, or
a member of either house of parliament, or to enjoy any office
or place of trust, either civil or military, or to have any grant
of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, from the Crown, to himself,
or to any other or others in trust for him.</p>

<p>That no person who has an office or place of profit under the
king, or receives a pension from the Crown, shall be capable of
serving as a member of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>That, after the said limitation shall take effect as aforesaid,
judges' commissions be made quamdiu se bene gesserint, and
their salaries ascertained and established; but, upon the address
of both houses of parliament, it may be lawful to remove them.</p>

<p>That no pardon under the great seal of England be pleadable
to an impeachment by the Commons in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
</p>

<p>The first of these provisions was well adapted to obviate the
jealousy which the succession of a new dynasty, bred in a
protestant church not altogether agreeing with our own, might
excite in our susceptible nation. A similar apprehension of
foreign government produced the second article, which so far
limits the royal prerogative that any minister who could be
proved to have advised or abetted a declaration of war in the
specified contingency would be criminally responsible to parliament.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>

The third article was repealed very soon after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
accession of George I., whose frequent journeys to Hanover
were an abuse of the graciousness with which the parliament
consented to annul the restriction.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Privy council superseded by a cabinet.</i>&mdash;A very remarkable
alteration that had been silently wrought in the course of the
executive government, gave rise to the fourth of the remedial
articles in the act of settlement. According to the original
constitution of our monarchy, the king had his privy council
composed of the great officers of state, and of such others as he
should summon to it, bound by an oath of fidelity and secrecy,
by whom all affairs of weight, whether as to domestic or exterior
policy, were debated for the most part in his presence, and
determined, subordinately of course to his pleasure, by the vote
of the major part. It could not happen but that some counsellors
more eminent than the rest should form juntos or cabals,
for more close and private management, or be selected as more
confidential advisers of their sovereign; and the very name of
a cabinet council, as distinguished from the large body, may
be found as far back as the reign of Charles I. But the resolutions
of the Crown, whether as to foreign alliances or the issuing
of proclamations and orders at home, or any other overt act of
government, were not finally taken without the deliberation
and assent of that body whom the law recognised as its sworn
and notorious counsellors. This was first broken in upon after
the restoration, and especially after the fall of Clarendon, a
strenuous assertor of the rights and dignity of the privy council.
"The king," as he complains, "had in his nature so little
reverence and esteem for antiquity, and did in truth so much
contemn old orders, forms, and institutions, that the objection
of novelty rather advanced than obstructed any proposition."<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>

He wanted to be absolute on the French plan, for which both
he and his brother, as the same historian tells us, had a great
predilection, rather than obtain a power little less arbitrary, so
far at least as private rights were concerned, on the system
of his three predecessors. The delays and the decencies of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
regular council, the continual hesitation of lawyers, were not
suited to his temper, his talents, or his designs. And it must
indeed be admitted that the privy council, even as it was then
constituted, was too numerous for the practical administration
of supreme power. Thus by degrees it became usual for the
ministry or cabinet to obtain the king's final approbation of
their measures, before they were laid, for a merely formal
ratification, before the council. It was one object of Sir William
Temple's short-lived scheme in 1679 to bring back the ancient
course; the king pledging himself on the formation of his new
privy council to act in all things by its advice.</p>

<p><i>Exclusion of placemen and pensioners from parliament.</i>&mdash;During
the reign of William, this distinction of the cabinet from
the privy council, and the exclusion of the latter from all business
of state became more fully established.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
 This however
produced a serious consequence as to the responsibility of the
advisers of the Crown; and at the very time when the controlling
and chastising power of parliament was most effectually
recognised, it was silently eluded by the concealment in which
the objects of its enquiry could wrap themselves. Thus, in the
instance of a treaty which the House of Commons might deem
mischievous and dishonourable, the chancellor setting the great
seal to it would of course be responsible; but it is not so evident
that the first lord of the treasury, or others more immediately
advising the Crown on the course of foreign policy, could be
liable to impeachment with any prospect of success, for an act
in which their participation could not be legally proved. I do
not mean that evidence may not possibly be obtained which
would affect the leaders of a cabinet, as in the instances of
Oxford and Bolingbroke; but that, the cabinet itself having
no legal existence, and its members being surely not amenable
to punishment in their simple capacity of privy counsellors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
which they generally share, in modern times, with a great
number even of their adversaries, there is no tangible character
to which responsibility is attached; nothing, except a signature
or the setting of a seal, from which a bad minister need entertain
any further apprehension than that of losing his post and reputation.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>

It may be that no absolute corrective is practicable
for this apparent deficiency in our constitutional security; but
it is expedient to keep it well in mind, because all ministers
speak loudly of their responsibility, and are apt, upon faith of
this imaginary guarantee, to obtain a previous confidence from
parliament which they may in fact abuse with impunity. For
should the bad success or detected guilt of their measures raise
a popular cry against them, and censure or penalty be demanded
by their opponents, they will infallibly shroud their persons in
the dark recesses of the cabinet, and employ every art to shift
off the burthen of individual liability.</p>

<p>William III., from the reservedness of his disposition as well
as from the great superiority of his capacity for affairs to any
of our former kings, was far less guided by any responsible
counsellors than the spirit of our constitution requires. In the
business of the partition treaty, which, whether rightly or otherwise,
the House of Commons reckoned highly injurious to the
public interest, he had not even consulted his cabinet; nor could
any minister, except the Earl of Portland and Lord Somers, be
proved to have had a concern in the transaction; for, though
the house impeached Lord Orford and Lord Halifax, they were
not in fact any farther parties to it than by being in the secret,
and the former had shown his usual intractability by objecting
to the whole measure. This was undoubtedly such a departure
from sound constitutional usage as left parliament no control
over the executive administration. It was endeavoured to
restore the ancient principle by this provision in the act of
settlement, that, after the accession of the house of Hanover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
all resolutions as to government should be debated in the privy
council, and signed by those present. But, whether it were
that real objections were found to stand in the way of this
article, or that ministers shrunk back from so definite a responsibility,
they procured its repeal a very few years afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>

The plans of government are discussed and determined in a
cabinet council, forming indeed part of the larger body, but
unknown to the law by any distinct character or special appointment.
I conceive, though I have not the means of tracing the
matter clearly, that this change has prodigiously augmented
the direct authority of the secretaries of state, especially as to
the interior department, who communicate the king's pleasure
in the first instance to subordinate officers and magistrates, in
cases which, down at least to the time of Charles I., would have
been determined in council. But proclamations and orders still
emanate, as the law requires, from the privy council; and on
some rare occasions, even of late years, matters of domestic
policy have been referred to their advice. It is generally understood,
however, that no counsellor is to attend, except when
summoned;<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
 so that, unnecessarily numerous as the council
has become, in order to gratify vanity by a titular honour,
these special meetings consist only of a few persons besides the
actual ministers of the cabinet, and give the latter no apprehension
of a formidable resistance. Yet there can be no reasonable
doubt that every counsellor is as much answerable for the
measures adopted by his consent, and especially when ratified
by his signature, as those who bear the name of ministers,
and who have generally determined upon them before he is
summoned.</p>

<p>The experience of William's partiality to Bentinck and
Keppel, in the latter instance not very consistent with the good
sense and dignity of his character, led to a strong measure of
precaution against the probable influence of foreigners under
the new dynasty; the exclusion of all persons not born within
the dominions of the British Crown from every office of civil
and military trust, and from both houses of parliament. No
other country, as far as I recollect, has adopted so sweeping a
disqualification; and it must, I think, be admitted that it goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
a greater length than liberal policy can be said to warrant.
But the narrow prejudices of George I. were well restrained by
this provision from gratifying his corrupt and servile German
favourites with lucrative offices.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
</p>

<p>The next article is of far more importance; and would, had
it continued in force, have perpetuated that struggle between
the different parts of the legislature, especially the Crown and
House of Commons, which the new limitations of the monarchy
were intended to annihilate. The baneful system of rendering
the parliament subservient to the administration, either by
offices and pensions held at pleasure, or by more clandestine
corruption, had not ceased with the house of Stuart. William,
not long after his accession, fell into the worst part of this
management, which it was most difficult to prevent; and, according
to the practice of Charles's reign, induced by secret bribes
the leaders of parliamentary opposition to betray their cause on
particular questions. The tory patriot, Sir Christopher Musgrave,
trod in the steps of the whig patriot, Sir Thomas Lee.
A large expenditure appeared every year, under the head of
secret service money; which was pretty well known, and
sometimes proved, to be disposed of, in great part, among the
members of both houses.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
 No check was put on the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
or quality of placemen in the lower house. New offices were
continually created, and at unreasonable salaries. Those who
desired to see a regard to virtue and liberty in the parliament
of England could not be insensible to the enormous mischief of
this influence. If some apology might be offered for it in the
precarious state of the revolution government, this did not take
away the possibility of future danger, when the monarchy
should have regained its usual stability. But in seeking for a
remedy against the peculiar evil of the times, the party in opposition
to the court during this reign, whose efforts at reformation
were too frequently misdirected, either through faction or some
sinister regards towards the deposed family, went into the preposterous
extremity of banishing all servants of the Crown
from the House of Commons. Whether the bill for free and
impartial proceedings in parliament, which was rejected by a
very small majority of the House of Lords in 1693, and having
in the next session passed through both houses, met with the
king's negative, to the great disappointment and displeasure of
the Commons, was of this general nature, or excluded only
certain specified officers of the Crown, I am not able to determine;
though the prudence and expediency of William's refusal
must depend entirely upon that question.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
 But in the act of
settlement, the clause is quite without exception; and, if it
had ever taken effect, no minister could have had a seat in the
House of Commons, to bring forward, explain, or defend the
measures of the executive government. Such a separation and
want of intelligence between the Crown and parliament must
either have destroyed the one, or degraded the other. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
House of Commons would either, in jealousy and passion, have
armed the strength of the people to subvert the monarchy, or,
losing that effective control over the appointment of ministers,
which has sometimes gone near to their nomination, would have
fallen almost into the condition of those states-general of ancient
kingdoms, which have met only to be cajoled into subsidies,
and give a passive consent to the propositions of the court. It
is one of the greatest safeguards of our liberty, that eloquent
and ambitious men, such as aspire to guide the councils of the
Crown, are from habit and use so connected with the houses of
parliament, and derive from them so much of their renown and
influence, that they lie under no temptation, nor could without
insanity be prevailed upon, to diminish the authority and
privileges of that assembly. No English statesman, since the
revolution, can be liable to the very slightest suspicion of an
aim, or even a wish, to establish absolute monarchy on the ruins
of our constitution. Whatever else has been done, or designed
to be done amiss, the rights of parliament have been out of
danger. They have, whenever a man of powerful mind shall
direct the cabinet, and none else can possibly be formidable,
the strong security of his own interest, which no such man will
desire to build on the caprice and intrigue of a court. And, as
this immediate connection of the advisers of the Crown with the
House of Commons, so that they are, and ever profess themselves,
as truly the servants of one as of the other, is a pledge
for their loyalty to the entire legislature, as well as to their
sovereign (I mean, of course, as to the fundamental principles
of our constitution), so has it preserved for the Commons
their preponderating share in the executive administration, and
elevated them in the eyes of foreign nations, till the monarchy
itself has fallen comparatively into shade. The pulse of Europe
beats according to the tone of our parliament; the counsels
of our kings are there revealed, and by that kind of previous
sanction which it has been customary to obtain, become, as it
were, the resolutions of a senate; and we enjoy the individual
pride and dignity which belong to republicans, with the steadiness
and tranquillity which the supremacy of a single person has
been supposed peculiarly to bestow.</p>

<p>But, if the chief ministers of the Crown are indispensably to
be present in one or other house of parliament, it by no means
follows that the doors should be thrown open to all those subaltern
retainers, who, too low to have had any participation in
the measures of government, come merely to earn their salaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
by a sure and silent vote. Unless some limitation could be put
on the number of such officers, they might become the majority
of every parliament, especially if its duration were indefinite or
very long. It was always the popular endeavour of the opposition,
or, as it was usually denominated, the country party, to
reduce the number of these dependants; and as constantly
the whole strength of the court was exerted to keep them up.
William, in truth, from his own errors, and from the disadvantage
of the times, would not venture to confide in an unbiassed
parliament. On the formation, however, of a new board of
revenue, in 1694, for managing the stamp-duties, its members
were incapacitated from sitting in the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>

This, I believe, is the first instance of exclusion on account of
employment; and a similar act was obtained in 1699, extending
this disability to the commissioners and some other officers of
excise.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
 But when the absolute exclusion of all civil and military
officers by the act of settlement was found, on cool reflection,
too impracticable to be maintained, and a revision of that
article took place in the year 1706, the House of Commons were
still determined to preserve at least the principle of limitation,
as to the number of placemen within their walls. They gave
way indeed to the other house in a considerable degree, receding,
with some unwillingness, from a clause specifying expressly the
description of offices which should not create a disqualification,
and consenting to an entire repeal of the original article.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
 But
they established two provisions of great importance, which still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
continue the great securities against an overwhelming influence:
first, that every member of the House of Commons accepting
an office under the Crown, except a higher commission in the
army, shall vacate his seat, and a new writ shall issue; secondly,
that no person holding an office created since the 25th of October
1705, shall be capable of being elected or re-elected at all.
They excluded at the same time all such as held pensions during
the pleasure of the Crown; and, to check the multiplication of
placemen, enacted, that no greater number of commissioners
should be appointed to execute any office than had been employed
in its execution at some time before that parliament.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>

These restrictions ought to be rigorously and jealously maintained,
and to receive a construction, in doubtful cases, according
to their constitutional spirit; not as if they were of a penal
nature towards individuals, an absurdity in which the careless
and indulgent temper of modern times might sometimes
acquiesce.</p>

<p><i>Independence of judges.</i>&mdash;It had been the practice of the
Stuarts, especially in the last years of their dynasty, to dismiss
judges, without seeking any other pretence, who showed any
disposition to thwart government in political prosecutions. The
general behaviour of the bench had covered it with infamy.
Though the real security for an honest court of justice must be
found in their responsibility to parliament and to public opinion,
it was evident that their tenure in office must, in the first place,
cease to be precarious, and their integrity rescued from the
severe trial of forfeiting the emoluments upon which they subsisted.
In the debates previous to the declaration of rights,
we find that several speakers insisted on making the judges'
commissions <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quamdiu se bene gesserint</span></i>, that is, during life or
good behaviour, instead of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">durante placito</span></i>, at the discretion of
the Crown. The former, indeed, is said to have been the
ancient course till the reign of James I. But this was omitted
in the hasty and imperfect bill of rights. The commissions
however of William's judges ran <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quamdiu se bene gesserint</span></i>. But
the king gave an unfortunate instance of his very injudicious
tenacity of bad prerogatives, in refusing his assent, in 1692,
to a bill that had passed both houses, for establishing this
independence of the judges by law and confirming their salaries.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>

We owe this important provision to the act of settlement; not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
as ignorance and adulation have perpetually asserted, to his
late majesty George III. No judge can be dismissed from
office, except in consequence of a conviction for some offence,
or the address of both houses of parliament, which is tantamount
to an act of the legislature.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
 It is always to be kept in
mind that they are still accessible to the hope of further promotion,
to the zeal of political attachment, to the flattery of
princes and ministers; that the bias of their prejudices, as
elderly and peaceable men, will, in a plurality of cases, be on
the side of power; that they have very frequently been trained,
as advocates, to vindicate every proceeding of the Crown; from
all which we should look on them with some little vigilance, and
not come hastily to a conclusion that, because their commissions
cannot be vacated by the Crown's authority, they are wholly
out of the reach of its influence. I would by no means be misinterpreted,
as if the general conduct of our courts of justice
since the revolution, and especially in later times, which in most
respects have been the best times, were not deserving of that
credit it has usually gained; but possibly it may have been
more guided and kept straight than some are willing to acknowledge
by the spirit of observation and censure which modifies
and controls our whole government.</p>

<p>The last clause in the act of settlement, that a pardon under
the great seal shall not be pleadable in bar of an impeachment,
requires no particular notice beyond what has been said on the
subject in a former chapter.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Oath of abjuration.</i>&mdash;In the following session a new parliament
having been assembled, in which the tory faction had less
influence than in the last, and Louis XIV. having, in the meantime,
acknowledged the son of James as King of England, the
natural resentment of this insult and breach of faith was shown
in a more decided assertion of revolution principles than had
hitherto been made. The pretended king was attainted of
high treason; a measure absurd as a law, but politic as a denunciation
of perpetual enmity.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
 It was made high treason to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
correspond with him, or remit money for his service. And a
still more vigorous measure was adopted, an oath to be taken,
not only by all civil officers, but by all ecclesiastics, members of
the universities, and schoolmasters, acknowledging William as
lawful and rightful king, and denying any right or title in the
pretended Prince of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
 The tories, and especially Lord
Nottingham, had earnestly contended, in the beginning of the
king's reign, against those words on the act of recognition, which
asserted William and Mary to be rightfully and lawfully king
and queen. They opposed the association at the time of the
assassination plot, on account of the same epithets, taking a
distinction which satisfied the narrow understanding of Nottingham,
and served as a subterfuge for more cunning men, between
a king whom they were bound in all cases to obey and one whom
they could style rightful and lawful. These expressions were
in fact slightly modified on that occasion; yet fifteen peers and
ninety-two commoners declined, at least for a time, to sign it.
The present oath of abjuration therefore was a signal victory
of the whigs who boasted of the revolution over the tories who
excused it.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
 The renunciation of the hereditary right, for at
this time few of the latter party believed in the young man's
spuriousness, was complete and unequivocal. The dominant
faction might enjoy perhaps a charitable pleasure in exposing
many of their adversaries, and especially the high church clergy,
to the disgrace and remorse of perjury. Few or none however
who had taken the oath of allegiance, refused this additional
cup of bitterness, though so much less defensible, according to
the principles they had employed to vindicate their compliance
in the former instance; so true it is that, in matters of conscience,
the first scruple is the only one which it costs much to
overcome. But the imposition of this test, as was evident in
a few years, did not check the boldness, or diminish the numbers,
of the Jacobites; and I must confess, that of all sophistry that
weakens moral obligation, that is the most pardonable, which
men employ to escape from this species of tyranny. The state
may reasonably make an entire and heartfelt attachment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
its authority the condition of civil trust; but nothing more than
a promise of peaceable obedience can justly be exacted from
those who ask only to obey in peace. There was a bad spirit
abroad in the church, ambitious, factious, intolerant, calumnious;
but this was not necessarily partaken by all its members,
and many excellent men might deem themselves hardly dealt
with in requiring their denial of an abstract proposition, which
did not appear so totally false according to their notions of the
English constitution and the church's doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="s08">ON THE STATE OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE REIGNS OF
ANNE, GEORGE I., AND GEORGE II.</span></h2>

<p>The act of settlement was the seal of our constitutional laws,
the complement of the revolution itself and the bill of rights,
the last great statute which restrains the power of the Crown,
and manifests, in any conspicuous degree, a jealousy of parliament
in behalf of its own and the subject's privileges. The
battle had been fought and gained; the statute-book, as it
becomes more voluminous, is less interesting in the history of
our constitution; the voice of petition, complaint, or remonstrance
is seldom to be traced in the Journals; the Crown in
return desists altogether, not merely from the threatening or
objurgatory tone of the Stuarts, but from that dissatisfaction
sometimes apparent in the language of William; and the vessel
seems riding in smooth water, moved by other impulses, and
liable perhaps to other dangers, than those of the ocean-wave
and the tempest. The reigns, accordingly, of Anne, George I.,
and George II., afford rather materials for dissertation, than
consecutive facts for such a work as the present; and may be
sketched in a single chapter, though by no means the least
important, which the reader's study and reflection must enable
him to fill up. Changes of an essential nature were in operation
during the sixty years of these three reigns, as well as in that
beyond the limits of this undertaking, which in length measures
them all; some of them greatly enhancing the authority of the
Crown, or rather of the executive government, while others had
so opposite a tendency, that philosophical speculators have not
been uniform in determining on which side was the sway of the
balance.</p>

<p><i>Distinctive principles of whigs and tories.</i>&mdash;No clear understanding
can be acquired of the political history of England
without distinguishing, with some accuracy of definition, the
two great parties of whig and tory. But this is not easy;
because those denominations being sometimes applied to
factions in the state, intent on their own aggrandisement, sometimes
to the principles they entertained or professed, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
become equivocal, and do by no means, at all periods and on all
occasions, present the same sense; an ambiguity which has been
increased by the lax and incorrect use of familiar language. We
may consider the words, in the first instance, as expressive of
a political theory or principle, applicable to the English government.
They were originally employed at the time of the bill
of exclusion, though the distinction of the parties they denote
is evidently at least as old as the long parliament. Both of these
parties, it is material to observe, agreed in the maintenance of
the constitution; that is, in the administration of government
by an hereditary sovereign, and in the concurrence of that
sovereign with the two houses of parliament in legislation, as
well as in those other institutions which have been reckoned
most ancient and fundamental. A favourer of unlimited
monarchy was not a tory, neither was a republican a whig.
Lord Clarendon was a tory, Hobbes was not; Bishop Hoadley
was a whig, Milton was not. But they differed mainly in this;
that to a tory the constitution, inasmuch as it was the constitution,
was an ultimate point, beyond which he never looked,
and from which he thought it altogether impossible to swerve;
whereas the whig deemed all forms of government subordinate
to the public good, and therefore liable to change when they
should cease to promote that object. Within those bounds
which he, as well as his antagonist, meant not to transgress,
and rejecting all unnecessary innovation, the whig had a natural
tendency to political improvement, the tory an aversion to it.
The one loved to descant on liberty and the rights of mankind,
the other on the mischiefs of sedition and the rights of kings.
Though both, as I have said, admitted a common principle,
the maintenance of the constitution, yet this made the privileges
of the subject, that the Crown's prerogative, his peculiar care.
Hence it seemed likely that, through passion and circumstance,
the tory might aid in establishing despotism, or the whig in
subverting monarchy. The former was generally hostile to the
liberty of the press, and to freedom of enquiry, especially in
religion; the latter their friend. The principle of the one, in
short, was melioration; of the other, conservation.</p>

<p>But the distinctive characters of whig and tory were less
plainly seen, after the revolution and act of settlement, in
relation to the Crown, than to some other parts of our polity.
The tory was ardently, and in the first place, the supporter of
the church in as much pre-eminence and power as he could give
it. For the church's sake, when both seemed as it were on one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
plank, he sacrificed his loyalty; for her he was always ready
to persecute the catholic, and if the times permitted not to
persecute, yet to restrain and discountenance, the nonconformist.
He came unwillingly into the toleration, which the
whig held up as one of the great trophies of the revolution. The
whig spurned at the haughty language of the church, and treated
the dissenters with moderation, or perhaps with favour. This
distinction subsisted long after the two parties had shifted their
ground as to civil liberty and royal power. Again; a predilection
for the territorial aristocracy, and for a government
chiefly conducted by their influence, a jealousy of new men,
of the mercantile interest, of the commonalty, never failed to
mark the genuine tory. It has been common to speak of the
whigs as an aristocratical faction. Doubtless the majority of
the peerage from the revolution downwards to the death of
George II. were of that denomination. But this is merely
an instance wherein the party and the principle are to be distinguished.
The natural bias of the aristocracy is towards the
Crown; but, except in most part of the reign of Anne, the Crown
might be reckoned with the whig party. No one who reflects
on the motives which are likely to influence the judgment of
classes in society, would hesitate to predict that an English
House of Lords would contain a larger proportion of men
inclined to the tory principle than of the opposite school; and
we do not find that experience contradicts this anticipation.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that I have given to each of these political
principles a moral character; and have considered them as they
would subsist in upright and conscientious men, not as we may
find them "in the dregs of Romulus," suffocated by selfishness
or distorted by faction. The whigs appear to have taken a far
more comprehensive view of the nature and ends of civil society;
their principle is more virtuous, more flexible to the variations
of time and circumstance, more congenial to large and masculine
intellects. But it may probably be no small advantage that the
two parties, or rather the sentiments which have been presumed
to actuate them, should have been mingled, as we find them, in
the complex mass of the English nation, whether the proportions
may or not have been always such as we might desire. They
bear some analogy to the two forces which retain the planetary
bodies in their orbits; the annihilation of one would disperse
them into chaos, that of the other would drag them to a centre.
And, though I cannot reckon these old appellations by any
means characteristic of our political factions in the nineteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
century, the names whig and tory are often well applied to
individuals. Nor can it be otherwise; since they are founded
not only on our laws and history, with which most have some
acquaintance, but in the diversities of condition and of moral
temperament generally subsisting among mankind.</p>

<p>It is, however, one thing to prefer the whig principle, another
to justify, as an advocate, the party which bore that name. So
far as they were guided by that principle, I hold them far more
friendly to the great interests of the commonwealth than their
adversaries. But, in truth, the peculiar circumstances of these
four reigns after the revolution, the spirit of faction, prejudice,
and animosity, above all, the desire of obtaining or retaining
power, which, if it be ever sought as a means, is soon converted
into an end, threw both parties very often into a false position,
and gave to each the language and sentiments of the other; so
that the two principles are rather to be traced in writings, and
those not wholly of a temporary nature, than in the debates of
parliament. In the reigns of William and Anne, the whigs,
speaking of them generally as a great party, had preserved their
original character unimpaired far more than their opponents.
All that had passed in the former reign served to humble the
tories, and to enfeeble their principle. The revolution itself, and
the votes upon which it was founded, the bill of recognition in
1690, the repeal of the non-resisting test, the act of settlement,
the oath of abjuration, were solemn adjudications, as it were,
against their creed. They took away the old argument, that
the letter of the law was on their side. If this indeed were all
usurpation, the answer was ready; but those who did not care
to make it, or by their submission put it out of their power, were
compelled to sacrifice not a little of that which had entered into
the definition of a tory. Yet even this had not a greater effect
than that systematic jealousy and dislike of the administration,
which made them encroach, according to ancient notions, and
certainly their own, on the prerogative of William. They
learned in this no unpleasing lesson to popular assemblies, to
magnify their own privileges and the rights of the people. This
tone was often assumed by the friends of the exiled family, and
in them it was without any dereliction of their object. It was
natural that a jacobite should use popular topics in order to
thwart and subvert an usurping government. His faith was
to the crown, but to the crown on a right head. In a tory who
voluntarily submitted to the reigning prince, such an opposition
to the prerogative was repugnant to the maxims of his creed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and placed him, as I have said, in a false position. This is of
course applicable to the reigns of George I. and II., and in a
greater degree in proportion as the tory and jacobite were more
separated than they had been perhaps under William.</p>

<p>The tories gave a striking proof how far they might be brought
to abandon their theories, in supporting an address to the
queen that she would invite the Princess Sophia to take up her
residence in England; a measure so unnatural as well as imprudent
that some have ascribed it to a subtlety of politics
which I do not comprehend. But we need not, perhaps, look
farther than to the blind rage of a party just discarded, who,
out of pique towards their sovereign, made her more irreconcilably
their enemy, and while they hoped to brand their
opponents with inconsistency, forgot that the imputation would
redound with tenfold force on themselves. The whigs justly
resisted a proposal so little called for at that time; but it led
to an act for the security of the succession, designating a regency
in the event of the queen's decease, and providing that the actual
parliament, or the last, if none were in being, should meet
immediately, and continue for six months, unless dissolved by
the successor.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
</p>

<p>In the conduct of this party, generally speaking, we do not,
I think, find any abandonment of the cause of liberty. The
whigs appear to have been zealous for bills excluding placemen
from the house, or limiting their numbers in it; and the abolition
of the Scots privy council, an odious and despotic tribunal, was
owing in a great measure to the authority of Lord Somers.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>

In these measures however the tories generally co-operated,
and it is certainly difficult in the history of any nation, to
separate the influence of sincere patriotism from that of
animosity and thirst of power. But one memorable event in
the reign of Anne gave an opportunity for bringing the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
theories of government into collision, to the signal advantage
of that which the Whigs professed; I mean, the impeachment
of Dr. Sacheverell. Though with a view to the interests of
their ministry, this prosecution was very unadvised, and has
been deservedly censured, it was of high importance in a constitutional
light, and is not only the most authentic exposition,
but the most authoritative ratification, of the principles upon
which the revolution is to be defended.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
</p>

<p>The charge against Sacheverell was, not for impugning what
was done at the revolution, which he affected to vindicate, but
for maintaining that it was not a case of resistance to the supreme
power, and consequently no exception to his tenet of an unlimited
passive obedience. The managers of the impeachment
had therefore not only to prove that there was resistance in the
revolution, which could not of course be sincerely disputed, but
to assert the lawfulness, in great emergencies, or what is called
in politics necessity, of taking arms against the law&mdash;a delicate
matter to treat of at any time, and not least so by ministers of
state and law officers of the Crown, in the very presence, as they
knew, of their sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
 We cannot praise too highly their
speeches upon this charge; some shades, rather of discretion
than discordance, may be perceptible; and we may distinguish
the warmth of Lechmere, or the openness of Stanhope, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the caution of Walpole, who betrays more anxiety than his
colleagues to give no offence in the highest quarter; but in every
one the same fundamental principles of the whig creed, except
on which indeed the impeachment could not rest, are unambiguously
proclaimed. "Since we must give up our right
to the laws and liberties of this kingdom," says Sir Joseph Jekyll,
"or, which is all one, be precarious in the enjoyment of them,
and hold them only during pleasure, if this doctrine of unlimited
non-resistance prevails, the Commons have been content to
undertake this prosecution."<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
&mdash;"The doctrine of unlimited,
unconditional, passive obedience," says Mr. Walpole, "was first
invented to support arbitrary and despotic power, and was never
promoted or countenanced by any government that had not
designs some time or other of making use of it."<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
 And thus
General Stanhope still more vigorously: "As to the doctrine
itself of absolute non-resistance, it should seem needless to
prove by arguments that it is inconsistent with the law of reason,
with the law of nature, and with the practice of all ages and
countries. Nor is it very material what the opinions of some
particular divines, or even the doctrine generally preached in
some particular reigns, may have been concerning it. It is
sufficient for us to know what the practice of the church of
England has been, when it found itself oppressed. And indeed
one may appeal to the practice of all churches, of all states, and
of all nations in the world, how they behaved themselves when
they found their civil and religious constitutions invaded and
oppressed by tyranny. I believe we may further venture to say,
that there is not at this day subsisting any nation or government
in the world, whose first original did not receive its
foundation either from resistance or compact; and as to our
purpose, it is equal if the latter be admitted. For wherever
compact is admitted, there must be admitted likewise a right
to defend the rights accruing by such compact. To argue the
municipal laws of a country in this case is idle. Those laws
were only made for the common course of things, and can never
be understood to have been designed to defeat the end of all
laws whatsoever; which would be the consequence of a nation's
tamely submitting to a violation of all their divine and human
rights."<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
 Mr. Lechmere argues to the same purpose in yet
stronger terms.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
</p>

<p>But, if these managers for the commons were explicit in their
assertion of the whig principle, the counsel for Sacheverell by no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
means unfurled the opposite banner with equal courage. In
this was chiefly manifested the success of the former. His
advocates had recourse to the petty chicane of arguing that he
had laid down a general rule of obedience without mentioning its
exceptions, that the revolution was a case of necessity, and that
they fully approved what was done therein. They set up a
distinction, which, though at that time perhaps novel, has
sometimes since been adopted by tory writers; that resistance
to the supreme power was indeed utterly illegal on any pretence
whatever, but that the supreme power in this kingdom was the
legislature, not the king; and that the revolution took effect
by the concurrence of the Lords and Commons.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
 This is of
itself a descent from the high ground of toryism, and would not
have been held by the sincere bigots of that creed. Though
specious, however, the argument is a sophism, and does not meet
the case of the revolution. For, though the supreme power
may be said to reside in the legislature, yet the prerogative
within its due limits is just as much part of the constitution,
and the question of resistance to lawful authority remains as
before. Even if this resistance had been made by the two
houses of parliament, it was but the case of the civil war, which
had been explicitly condemned by more than one statute of
Charles II. But, as Mr. Lechmere said in reply, it was undeniable
that the Lords and Commons did not join in that
resistance at the revolution as part of the legislative and supreme
power, but as part of the collective body of the nation.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
 And
Sir John Holland had before observed, "that there was a resistance
at the revolution was most plain, if taking up arms in
Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Cheshire, and almost all the
counties of England; if the desertion of a prince's own troops to
an invading prince, and turning their arms against their sovereign,
be resistance."<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
 It might in fact have been asked
whether the Dukes of Leeds and Shrewsbury, then sitting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
judgment on Sacheverell (and who afterwards voted him not
guilty) might not have been convicted of treason, if the Prince
of Orange had failed of success?<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
 The advocates indeed of the
prisoner made so many concessions as amounted to an abandonment
of all the general question. They relied chiefly on
numerous passages in the homilies, and most approved writers
of the Anglican church, asserting the duty of unbounded passive
obedience. But the managers eluded these in their reply with
decent respect.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
 The Lords voted Sacheverell guilty by a
majority of 67 to 59; several voting on each side rather according
to their present faction than their own principles. They
passed a slight sentence, interdicting him only from preaching
for three years. This was deemed a sort of triumph by his
adherents; but a severe punishment on a wretch so insignificant
would have been misplaced; and the sentence may be compared
to the nominal damages sometimes given in a suit instituted for
the trial of a great right.</p>

<p><i>Revolution in the ministry under Anne.</i>&mdash;The shifting combinations
of party in the reign of Anne, which affected the
original distinctions of whig and tory, though generally known,
must be shortly noticed. The queen, whose understanding and
fitness for government were below mediocrity, had been attached
to the tories, and bore an antipathy to her predecessor. Her
first ministry, her first parliament, gave presage of a government
to be wholly conducted by that party. But this prejudice was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
counteracted by the persuasions of that celebrated favourite,
the wife of Marlborough, who, probably from some personal
resentments, had thrown her influence into the scale of the
whigs. The well known records of their conversation and
correspondence present a strange picture of good-natured feebleness
on one side, and of ungrateful insolence on the other. But
the interior of a court will rarely endure daylight. Though
Godolphin and Marlborough, in whom the queen reposed her
entire confidence, had been thought tories, they became gradually
alienated from that party, and communicated their own
feelings to the queen. The House of Commons very reasonably
declined to make an hereditary grant to the latter out of the
revenues of the post-office in 1702, when he had performed
no extraordinary services; though they acceded to it without
hesitation after the battle of Blenheim.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
 This gave some offence
to Anne; and the chief tory leaders in the cabinet, Rochester,
Nottingham, and Buckingham, displaying a reluctance to carry
on the war with such vigour as Marlborough knew to be necessary,
were soon removed from office. Their revengeful attack
on the queen, in the address to invite the Princess Sophia, made
a return to power hopeless for several years. Anne however
entertained a desire very natural to an English sovereign, yet in
which none but a weak one will expect to succeed, of excluding
chiefs of parties from her councils. Disgusted with the
tories, she was loth to admit the whigs; and thus Godolphin's
administration, from 1704 to 1708, was rather suddenly supported,
sometimes indeed thwarted, by that party. Cowper
was made chancellor against the queen's wishes;<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
 but the
junto, as it was called, of five eminent whig peers, Somers,
Halifax, Wharton, Orford, and Sunderland, were kept out
through the queen's dislike, and in some measure, no question,
through Godolphin's jealousy. They forced themselves into
the cabinet about 1708; and effected the dismissal of Harley
and St. John, who, though not of the regular tory school in
connection or principle, had already gone along with that faction
in the late reign, and were now reduced by their dismissal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
unite with it.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
 The whig ministry of Queen Anne, so often
talked of, cannot in fact be said to have existed more than two
years, from 1708 to 1710; her previous administration having
been at first tory, and afterwards of a motley complexion,
though depending for existence on the great whig interest which
it in some degree proscribed. Every one knows that this
ministry was precipitated from power through the favourite's
abuse of her ascendancy, become at length intolerable to the
most forbearing of queens and mistresses, conspiring with
another intrigue of the bedchamber, and the popular clamour
against Sacheverell's impeachment. It seems rather an humiliating
proof of the sway which the feeblest prince enjoys even in a
limited monarchy, that the fortunes of Europe should have been
changed by nothing more noble than the insolence of one
waiting-woman and the cunning of another. It is true that this
was effected by throwing the weight of the Crown into the
scale of a powerful faction; yet the house of Bourbon would
probably not have reigned beyond the Pyrenees, but for Sarah
and Abigail at Queen Anne's toilet.</p>

<p><i>War of the succession.</i>&mdash;The object of the war, as it is
commonly called, of the Grand Alliance, commenced in 1702,
was, as expressed in an address of the House of Commons, for
preserving the liberties of Europe and reducing the exorbitant
power of France.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
 The occupation of the Spanish dominions
by the Duke of Anjou, on the authority of the late king's will,
was assigned as its justification, together with the acknowledgment
of the pretended Prince of Wales as successor to his father
James. Charles, Archduke of Austria, was recognised as King
of Spain; and as early as 1705 the restoration of that monarchy
to his house is declared in a speech from the throne to be not
only safe and advantageous, but glorious to England.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
 Louis
XIV. had perhaps at no time much hope of retaining for his
grandson the whole inheritance he claimed; and on several
occasions made overtures for negotiation, but such as indicated
his design of rather sacrificing the detached possessions of Italy
and the Netherlands than Spain itself and the Indies.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
 After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the battle of Oudenarde, however, and the loss of Lille in the
campaign of 1708, the exhausted state of France and discouragement
of his court induced him to acquiesce in the cession of the
Spanish monarchy as a basis of treaty. In the conferences of
the Hague in 1709, he struggled for a time to preserve Naples and
Sicily; but ultimately admitted the terms imposed by the allies,
with the exception of the famous thirty-seventh article of the
preliminaries, binding him to procure by force or persuasion the
resignation of the Spanish crown by his grandson within two
months. This proposition he declared to be both dishonourable
and impracticable; and, the allies refusing to give way, the
negotiation was broken off. It was renewed the next year
at Gertruydenburg; but the same obstacle still proved insurmountable.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
</p>

<p>It has been the prevailing opinion in modern times that the
English ministry, rather against the judgment of their allies of
Holland, insisted upon a condition not indispensable to their
security, and too ignominious for their fallen enemy to accept.
Some may perhaps incline to think that, even had Philip of
Anjou been suffered to reign in Naples, a possession rather
honourable than important, the balance of power would not
have been seriously affected, and the probability of durable
peace been increased. This, however, it was not necessary to
discuss. The main question is as to the power which the allies
possessed of securing the Spanish monarchy for the archduke,
if they had consented to waive the thirty-seventh article of the
preliminaries. If indeed they could have been considered as a
single potentate, it was doubtless possible, by means of keeping
up great armies on the frontier, and by the delivery of cautionary
towns, to have prevented the King of France from lending
assistance to his grandson. But, self-interested and disunited
as confederacies generally are, and as the grand alliance had
long since become, this appeared a very dangerous course of
policy, if Louis should be playing an underhand game against
his engagements. And this it was not then unreasonable to
suspect, even if we should believe, in despite of some plausible
authorities, that he was really sincere in abandoning so favourite
an interest. The obstinate adherence of Godolphin and Somers
to the preliminaries may possibly have been erroneous; but it
by no means deserves the reproach that has been unfairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
bestowed on it; nor can the whigs be justly charged with protracting
the war to enrich Marlborough, or to secure themselves
in power.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Treaty of peace broken off.</i>&mdash;The conferences at Gertruydenburg
were broken off in July 1710, because an absolute security
for the evacuation of Spain by Philip appeared to be wanting;
and within six months a fresh negotiation was secretly on foot,
the basis of which was his retention of that kingdom. For the
administration presided over by Godolphin had fallen meanwhile;
new counsellors, a new parliament, new principles of
government. The tories had from the beginning come very
reluctantly into the schemes of the grand alliance; though no
opposition to the war had ever been shown in parliament, it
was very soon perceived that the majority of that denomination
had their hearts bent on peace.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
 But instead of renewing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
negotiation in concert with the allies (which indeed might have
been impracticable), the new ministers fell upon the course of
a clandestine arrangement, in exclusion of all the other powers,
which led to the signature of preliminaries in September 1711,
and afterwards to the public congress of Utrecht, and the
celebrated treaty named from that town. Its chief provisions
are too well known to be repeated.</p>

<p><i>Arguments for and against the treaty of Utrecht.</i>&mdash;The arguments
in favour of a treaty of pacification, which should abandon
the great point of contest, and leave Philip in possession of Spain
and America, were neither few nor inconsiderable. 1. The
kingdom had been impoverished by twenty years of uninterruptedly
augmented taxation; the annual burthens being triple
in amount of those paid before the revolution. Yet, amidst
these sacrifices, we had the mortification of finding a debt rapidly
increasing, whereof the mere interest far exceeded the ancient
revenues of the Crown, to be bequeathed, like an hereditary
curse, to unborn ages. Though the supplies had been raised
with less difficulty than in the late reign, and the condition of
trade was less unsatisfactory, the landed proprietors saw with
indignation the silent transfer of their wealth to new men, and
hated the glory that was bought by their own degradation. Was
it not to be feared that they might hate also the revolution, and
the protestant succession that depended on it, when they tasted
these fruits it had borne? Even the army had been recruited
by violent means unknown to our constitution, yet such as the
continual loss of men, with a population at the best stationary,
had perhaps rendered necessary.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
</p>

<p>2. The prospect of reducing Spain to the archduke's obedience
was grown unfavourable. It was at best an odious work, and
not very defensible on any maxims of national justice, to impose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
a sovereign on a great people in despite of their own repugnance,
and what they deemed their loyal obligation. Heaven itself
might shield their righteous cause, and baffle the selfish rapacity
of human politics. But what was the state of the war at the
close of 1710? The surrender of 7000 English under Stanhope at
Brihuega had ruined the affairs of Charles, which in fact had at
no time been truly prosperous, and confined him to the single
province sincerely attached to him, Catalonia. As it was
certain that Philip had spirit enough to continue the war, even
if abandoned by his grandfather, and would have the support of
almost the entire nation, what remained but to carry on a very
doubtful contest for the subjugation of that extensive kingdom?
In Flanders, no doubt, the genius of Marlborough kept still
the ascendant; yet France had her Fabius in Villars; and the
capture of three or four small fortresses in a whole campaign did
not presage a rapid destruction of the enemy's power.</p>

<p>3. It was acknowledged that the near connection of the
monarchs on the thrones of France and Spain could not be
desired from Europe. Yet the experience of ages had shown
how little such ties of blood determined the policy of courts;
a Bourbon on the throne of Spain could not but assert the
honour, and even imbibe the prejudices, of his subjects; and
as the two nations were in all things opposite, and must clash
in their public interests, there was little reason to fear a subserviency
in the cabinet of Madrid, which, even in that absolute
monarchy, could not be displayed against the general sentiment.</p>

<p>4. The death of the Emperor Joseph, and election of the
Archduke Charles in his room, which took place in the spring of
1711, changed in no small degree the circumstances of Europe.
It was now a struggle to unite the Spanish and Austrian
monarchies under one head. Even if England might have little
interest to prevent this, could it be indifferent to the smaller
states of Europe that a family not less ambitious and encroaching
than that of Bourbon should be so enormously aggrandised?
France had long been to us the only source of apprehension;
but to some states, to Savoy, to Switzerland, to Venice, to the
principalities of the empire, she might justly appear a very
necessary bulwark against the aggressions of Austria. The
alliance could not be expected to continue faithful and unanimous,
after so important an alteration in the balance of power.</p>

<p>5. The advocates of peace and adherents of the new ministry
stimulated the national passions of England by vehement reproaches
of the allies. They had thrown, it was contended, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
despite of all treaties, an unreasonable proportion of expense
upon a country not directly concerned in their quarrel, and
rendered a negligent or criminal administration their dupes or
accomplices. We were exhausting our blood and treasure to
gain kingdoms for the house of Austria which insulted, and the
best towns of Flanders for the states-general who cheated us.
The barrier treaty of Lord Townshend was so extravagant, that
one might wonder at the presumption of Holland in suggesting
its articles, much more at the folly of our government in acceding
to them. It laid the foundation of endless dissatisfaction
on the side of Austria, thus reduced to act as the vassal of a
little republic in her own territories, and to keep up fortresses
at her own expense, which others were to occupy. It might be
anticipated that, at some time, a sovereign of that house would
be found more sensible to ignominy than to danger, who would
remove this badge of humiliation by dismantling the fortifications
which were thus to be defended. Whatever exaggeration
might be in these clamours, they were sure to pass for undeniable
truths with a people jealous of foreigners, and prone to believe
itself imposed upon, from a consciousness of general ignorance
and credulity.</p>

<p>These arguments were met by answers not less confident,
though less successful at the moment, than they had been
deemed convincing by the majority of politicians in later ages.
It was denied that the resources of the kingdom were so much
enfeebled; the supplies were still raised without difficulty;
commerce had not declined; public credit stood high under the
Godolphin ministry; and it was especially remarkable that the
change of administration, notwithstanding the prospect of peace,
was attended by a great fall in the price of stocks. France, on
the other hand, was notoriously reduced to the utmost distress;
and, though it were absurd to allege the misfortunes of our
enemy by way of consolation for our own, yet the more exhausted
of the two combatants was naturally that which ought to yield;
and it was not for the honour of our free government that we
should be outdone in magnanimous endurance for the sake of
the great interests of ourselves and our posterity by the
despotism we so boastfully scorned.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
 The King of France had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
now for half a century been pursuing a system of encroachment
on the neighbouring states, which the weakness of the two
branches of the Austrian house, and the perfidiousness of the
Stuarts, not less than the valour of his troops and skill of his
generals, had long rendered successful. The tide had turned
for the first time in the present war; victories more splendid
than were recorded in modern warfare had illustrated the
English name. Were we spontaneously to relinquish these
great advantages, and two years after Louis had himself consented
to withdraw his forces from Spain, our own arms having
been in the meantime still successful on the most important
scene of the contest, to throw up the game in despair, and leave
him far more the gainer at the termination of this calamitous
war, than he had been after those triumphant campaigns which
his vaunting medals commemorate? Spain of herself could
not resist the confederates, even if united in support of Philip;
which was denied as to the provinces composing the kingdom of
Arragon, and certainly as to Catalonia; it was in Flanders that
Castile was to be conquered; it was France that we were to
overcome; and now that her iron barrier had been broken
through, when Marlborough was preparing to pour his troops
upon the defenceless plains of Picardy, could we doubt that
Louis must in good earnest abandon the cause of his grandson,
as he had already pledged himself in the conferences of
Gertruydenburg?</p>

<p>2. It was easy to slight the influence which the ties of blood
exert over kings. Doubtless they are often torn asunder by
ambition or wounded pride. But it does not follow that they
have no efficacy; and the practice of courts in cementing
alliances by intermarriage seems to show that they are not
reckoned indifferent. It might, however, be admitted that a
king of Spain, such as she had been a hundred years before,
would probably be led by the tendency of his ambition into a
course of policy hostile to France. But that monarchy had
long been declining; great rather in name and extent of
dominion than intrinsic resources, she might perhaps rally for a
short period under an enterprising minister; but with such
inveterate abuses of government, and so little progressive
energy among the people, she must gradually sink lower in the
scale of Europe, till it might become the chief pride of her
sovereigns that they were the younger branches of the house
of Bourbon. To cherish this connection would be the policy of
the court of Versailles; there would result from it a dependent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
relation, an habitual subserviency of the weaker power, a family
compact of perpetual union, always opposed to Great Britain.
In distant ages, and after fresh combinations of the European
commonwealth should have seemed almost to efface the recollection
of Louis XIV. and the war of the succession, the Bourbons
on the French throne might still claim a sort of primogenitary
right to protect the dignity of the junior branch by interference
with the affairs of Spain; and a late posterity of those who
witnessed the peace of Utrecht might be entangled by its improvident
concessions.</p>

<p>3. That the accession of Charles to the empire rendered his
possession of the Spanish monarchy in some degree less desirable,
need not be disputed; though it would not be easy to prove that
it could endanger England, or even the smaller states, since it
was agreed on all hands that he was to be master of Milan
and Naples. But against this, perhaps imaginary, mischief the
opponents of the treaty set the risk of seeing the crowns of
France and Spain united on the head of Philip. In the years
1711 and 1712 the dauphin, the Duke of Burgundy, and the
Duke of Berry, were swept away. An infant stood alone between
the King of Spain and the French succession. The latter was
induced, with some unwillingness, to sign a renunciation of this
contingent inheritance. But it was notoriously the doctrine of
the French court that such renunciations were invalid; and the
sufferings of Europe were chiefly due to this tenet of indefeasible
royalty. It was very possible that Spain would never consent
to this union, and that a fresh league of the great powers might
be formed to prevent it; but, if we had the means of permanently
separating the two kingdoms in our hands, it was strange policy
to leave open this door for a renewal of the quarrel.</p>

<p>But whatever judgment we may be disposed to form as to
the political necessity of leaving Spain and America in the
possession of Philip, it is impossible to justify the course of that
negotiation which ended in the peace of Utrecht. It was at
best a dangerous and inauspicious concession, demanding every
compensation that could be devised, and which the circumstances
of the war entitled us to require. France was still our formidable
enemy; the ambition of Louis was still to be dreaded, his
intrigues to be suspected. That an English minister should
have thrown himself into the arms of this enemy at the first
overture of negotiation; that he should have renounced advantages
upon which he might have insisted; that he should
have restored Lille, and almost attempted to procure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
sacrifice of Tournay; that throughout the whole correspondence
and in all personal interviews with Torcy he should have shown
the triumphant Queen of Great Britain more eager for peace
than her vanquished adversary; that the two courts should have
been virtually conspiring against those allies, without whom we
had bound ourselves to enter on no treaty; that we should have
withdrawn our troops in the midst of a campaign, and even
seized upon the towns of our confederates while we left them
exposed to be overcome by a superior force; that we should have
first deceived those confederates by the most direct falsehood
in denying our clandestine treaty, and then dictated to them its
acceptance, are facts so disgraceful to Bolingbroke, and in somewhat
a less degree to Oxford, that they can hardly be palliated
by establishing the expediency of the treaty itself.</p>

<p><i>Intrigues of the Jacobites.</i>&mdash;For several years after the treaty of
Ryswick the intrigues of ambitious and discontented statesmen,
and of a misled faction in favour of the exiled family, grew
much colder; the old age of James and the infancy of his son
being alike incompatible with their success. The jacobites
yielded a sort of provisional allegiance to the daughter of their
king, deeming her, as it were, a regent in the heir's minority, and
willing to defer the consideration of his claim till he should be
competent to make it, or to acquiesce in her continuance upon
the throne, if she could be induced to secure his reversion.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>

Meanwhile, under the name of tories and high-church men, they
carried on a more dangerous war by sapping the bulwarks of
the revolution settlement. The disaffected clergy poured forth
sermons and libels, to impugn the principles of the whigs or
traduce their characters. Twice a year especially, on the 30th
of January and 29th of May, they took care that every stroke
upon rebellion and usurpation should tell against the expulsion
of the Stuarts and the Hanover succession. They inveighed
against the dissenters and the toleration. They set up pretences
of loyalty towards the queen, descanting sometimes on her
hereditary right, in order to throw a slur on the settlement.
They drew a transparent veil over their designs, which might
screen them from prosecution, but could not impose, nor was
meant to impose, on the reader. Among these the most distinguished
was Leslie, author of a periodical sheet called the
<i>Rehearsal</i>, printed weekly from 1704 to 1708; and as he, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
a non-juror, and unquestionable jacobite, held only the same
language as Sacheverell, and others who affected obedience to
the government, we cannot much be deceived in assuming that
their views were entirely the same.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
</p>

<p>The court of St. Germains, in the first years of the queen,
preserved a secret connection with Godolphin and Marlborough,
though justly distrustful of their sincerity; nor is it by any
means clear that they made any strong professions.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
 Their
evident determination to reduce the power of France, their
approximation towards the whigs, the averseness of the duchess
to jacobite principles, taught at length that unfortunate court
how little it had to expect from such ancient friends. The
Scotch jacobites, on the other hand, were eager for the young
king's immediate restoration; and their assurances finally
produced his unsuccessful expedition to the coast in 1708.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>

This alarmed the queen, who at least had no thoughts of giving
up any part of her dominions, and probably exasperated the
two ministers.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
 Though Godolphin's partiality to the Stuart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
cause was always suspected, the proofs of his intercourse with
their emissaries are not so strong as against Marlborough; who,
so late as 1711, declared himself more positively than he seems
hitherto to have done in favour of their restoration.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
 But the
extreme selfishness and treachery of his character makes it
difficult to believe that he had any further view than to secure
himself in the event of a revolution which he judged probable.
His interest, which was always his deity, did not lie in that
direction; and his great sagacity must have perceived it.</p>

<p><i>Just alarm for the Hanover succession.</i>&mdash;A more promising
overture had by this time been made to the young claimant
from an opposite quarter. Mr. Harley, about the end of 1710,
sent the Abbé Gaultier to Marshal Berwick (natural son of
James II. by Marlborough's sister), with authority to treat
about the restoration; Anne of course retaining the Crown for
her life, and securities being given for the national religion and
liberties. The conclusion of peace was a necessary condition.
The jacobites in the English parliament were directed in consequence
to fall in with the court, which rendered it decidedly
superior. Harley promised to send over in the next year a plan
for carrying that design into effect. But neither at that time,
nor during the remainder of the queen's life, did this dissembling
minister take any further measures, though still in strict connection
with that party at home, and with the court of St.
Germains.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
 It was necessary, he said, to proceed gently, to
make the army their own, to avoid suspicions which would be
fatal. It was manifest that the course of his administration
was wholly inconsistent with his professions; the friends of the
house of Stuart felt that he betrayed, though he did not delude
them; but it was the misfortune of this minister, or rather the
just and natural reward of crooked counsels, that those he meant
to serve could neither believe in his friendship, nor forgive his
appearances of enmity. It is doubtless not easy to pronounce
on the real intentions of men so destitute of sincerity as Harley
and Marlborough; but, in believing the former favourable to
the protestant succession, which he had so eminently contributed
to establish, we accede to the judgment of those contemporaries
who were best able to form one, and especially of the
very jacobites with whom he tampered. And this is so powerfully
confirmed by most of his public measures, his averseness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
to the high tories, and their consequent hatred of him, his
irreconcilable disagreement with those of his colleagues who
looked most to St. Germains, his frequent attempts to renew a
connection with the whigs, his contempt of the jacobite creed
of government, and the little prospect he could have had of
retaining power on such a revolution, that, so far at least as
may be presumed from what has hitherto become public,
there seems no reason for counting the Earl of Oxford among
those from whom the house of Hanover had any enmity to
apprehend.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
</p>

<p>The pretender, meanwhile, had friends in the tory government
more sincere probably and zealous than Oxford. In the
year 1712 Lord Bolingbroke, the Duke of Buckingham, president
of the council, and the Duke of Ormond, were engaged in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
connection.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
 The last of these, being in the command of the
army, little glory as that brought him, might become an important
auxiliary. Harcourt, the chancellor, though the proofs
are not, I believe, so direct, has always been reckoned in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
same interest. Several of the leading Scots peers, with little
disguise, avowed their adherence to it; especially the Duke of
Hamilton, who, luckily perhaps for the kingdom, lost his life
in a duel, at the moment when he was setting out on an embassy
to France. The rage expressed by that faction at his death
betrays the hopes they had entertained from him. A strong
phalanx of tory members, called the October Club, though by
no means entirely jacobite, were chiefly influenced by those who
were such. In the new parliament of 1713, the queen's precarious
health excited the Stuart partisans to press forward
with more zeal. The masque was more than half drawn aside;
and, vainly urging the ministry to fulfil their promises while yet
in time, they cursed the insidious cunning of Harley and the
selfish cowardice of the queen. Upon her they had for some
years relied. Lady Masham, the bosom favourite, was entirely
theirs; and every word, every look of the sovereign, had been
anxiously observed, in the hope of some indication that she
would take the road which affection and conscience, as they
fondly argued, must dictate. But, whatever may have been the
sentiments of Anne, her secret was never divulged, nor is there,
as I apprehend, however positively the contrary is sometimes
asserted, any decisive evidence whence we may infer that she
even intended her brother's restoration.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
 The weakest of mankind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
have generally an instinct of self-preservation which leads
them right, and perhaps more than stronger minds possess; and
Anne could scarcely help perceiving that her own deposition
from the throne would be the natural consequence of once
admitting the reversionary right of one whose claim was equally
good to the possession. The assertors of hereditary descent
could acquiesce in her usurpation no longer than they found it
necessary for their object; if her life should be protracted to an
ordinary duration, it was almost certain that Scotland first, and
afterwards England, would be wrested from her impotent grasp.
Yet, though I believe the queen to have been sensible of this, it
is impossible to pronounce with certainty that either through
pique against the house of Hanover, or inability to resist her
own counsellors, she might not have come into the scheme of
altering the succession.</p>

<p>But, if neither the queen nor her lord treasurer were inclined
to take that vigorous course which one party demanded, they
at least did enough to raise just alarm in the other; and it seems
strange to deny that the protestant succession was in danger.
As Lord Oxford's ascendancy diminished, the signs of impending
revolution became less equivocal. Adherents of the house of
Stuart were placed in civil and military trust; an Irish agent
of the pretender was received in the character of envoy from the
court of Spain; the most audacious manifestations of disaffection
were overlooked.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
 Several even in parliament spoke with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
contempt and aversion of the house of Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
 It was surely
not unreasonable in the whig party to meet these assaults of
the enemy with something beyond the ordinary weapons of an
opposition. They affected no apprehensions that it was absurd
to entertain. Those of the opposite faction, who wished well
to the protestant interest, and were called Hanoverian tories,
came over to their side, and joined them on motions that the
succession was in danger.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
 No one hardly, who either hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
or dreaded the consequences, had any doubts upon this score;
and it is only a few moderns who have assumed the privilege of
setting aside the persuasion of contemporaries upon a subject
which contemporaries were best able to understand.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
 Are we
then to censure the whigs for urging on the elector of Hanover,
who, by a strange apathy or indifference, seemed negligent of
the great prize reserved for him; or is the bold step of demanding
a writ of summons for the electoral prince as Duke of Cambridge
to pass for a factious insult on the queen, because, in her
imbecility, she was leaving the Crown to be snatched at by the
first comer, even if she were not, as they suspected, in some
conspiracy to bestow it on a proscribed heir?<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
 I am much
inclined to believe, that the great majority of the nation were in
favour of the protestant succession; but, if the princes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
house of Brunswick had seemed to retire from the contest, it
might have been impracticable to resist a predominant faction
in the council and in parliament; especially if the son of James,
listening to the remonstrances of his English adherents, could
have been induced to renounce a faith which, in the eyes of too
many, was the sole pretext for his exclusion.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Accession of George I.</i>&mdash;The queen's death, which came at last
perhaps rather more quickly than was foreseen, broke for ever
the fair prospects of her family. George I., unknown and
absent, was proclaimed without a single murmur, as if the Crown
had passed in the most regular descent. But this was a momentary
calm. The jacobite party, recovering from the first consternation,
availed itself of its usual arms, and of those with
which the new king injudiciously supplied it. Many of the
tories who would have acquiesced in the act of settlement, seem
to have looked on a leading share in the administration as
belonging of right to what was called the church party, and
complained of the formation of a ministry on the whig principle.
In later times also, it has been not uncommon to censure George
I. for governing, as it is called, by a faction. Nothing can be
more unreasonable than this reproach. Was he to select those
as his advisers, who had been, as we know and as he believed,
in a conspiracy with his competitor? Was Lord Oxford, even
if the king thought him faithful, capable of uniting with any
public men, hated as he was on each side? Were not the tories
as truly a faction as their adversaries, and as intolerant during
their own power?<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
 Was there not, above all, a danger that,
if some of one denomination were drawn by pique and disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
into the ranks of the jacobites, the whigs, on the
other hand, so ungratefully and perfidiously recompensed for
their arduous services to the house of Hanover, might think all
royalty irreconcilable with the principles of freedom, and raise
up a republican party, of which the scattered elements were
sufficiently discernible in the nation?<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
 The exclusion indeed
of the whigs would have been so monstrous both in honour and
policy, that the censure has generally fallen on their alleged
monopoly of public offices. But the mischiefs of a disunited,
hybrid ministry had been sufficiently manifest in the two last
reigns; nor could George, a stranger to his people and their
constitution, have undertaken without ruin that most difficult
task of balancing parties and persons, to which the great mind
of William had proved unequal. Nor is it true that the tories,
as such, were proscribed; those who chose to serve the court
met with court favour; and in the very outset the few men of
sufficient eminence, who had testified their attachment to the
succession, received equitable rewards; but, most happily for
himself and the kingdom, most reasonably according to the
principles on which alone his throne could rest, the first prince
of the house of Brunswick gave a decisive preponderance in
his favour to Walpole and Townshend above Harcourt and
Bolingbroke.</p>

<p><i>Great disaffection in the kingdom.</i>&mdash;The strong symptoms of
disaffection which broke out in a few months after the king's
accession, and which can be ascribed to no grievance, unless the
formation of a whig ministry was to be termed one, prove the
taint of the late times to have been deep seated and extensive.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
The clergy, in very many instances, were a curse rather than a
blessing to those over whom they were set; and the people,
while they trusted that from those polluted fountains they could
draw the living waters of truth, became the dupes of factious
lies and sophistry. Thus encouraged, the heir of the Stuarts
landed in Scotland; and the spirit of that people being in a
great measure jacobite, and very generally averse to the union,
he met with such success as, had their independence subsisted,
would probably have established him on the throne. But Scotland
was now doomed to wait on the fortunes of her more powerful
ally; and, on his invasion of England, the noisy partisans of
hereditary right discredited their faction by its cowardice. Few
rose in arms to support the rebellion, compared with those who
desired its success, and did not blush to see the gallant savages
of the Highlands shed their blood that a supine herd of priests
and country gentlemen might enjoy the victory. The severity
of the new government after the rebellion has been often blamed;
but I know not whether, according to the usual rules of policy,
it can be proved that the execution of two peers and thirty
other persons, taken with arms in flagrant rebellion, was an
unwarrantable excess of punishment. There seems a latent
insinuation in those who have argued on the other side, as if
the jacobite rebellion, being founded on an opinion of right,
was more excusable than an ordinary treason&mdash;a proposition
which it would not have been quite safe for the reigning dynasty
to acknowledge. Clemency however is the standing policy of
constitutional governments, as severity is of despotism; and,
if the ministers of George I. might have extended it to part of
the inferior sufferers (for surely those of higher rank were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
first to be selected) with safety to their master, they would have
done well in sparing him the odium that attends all political
punishments.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Impeachment of tory ministers.</i>&mdash;It will be admitted on all
hands, at the present day, that the charge of high treason in
the impeachments against Oxford and Bolingbroke was an
intemperate excess of resentment at their scandalous dereliction
of the public honour and interest. The danger of a sanguinary
revenge inflamed by party spirit is so tremendous that the worst
of men ought perhaps to escape rather than suffer by a retrospective,
or, what is no better, a constructive, extension of the
law. The particular charge of treason was, that in the negotiation
for peace they had endeavoured to procure the city of
Tournay for the King of France; which was maintained to be
an adhering to the queen's enemies within the statute of Edward
III.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
 But, as this construction could hardly be brought within
the spirit of that law, and the motive was certainly not treasonable
or rebellious, it would have been incomparably more constitutional
to treat so gross a breach of duty as a misdemeanour
of the highest kind. This angry temper of the Commons led
ultimately to the abandonment of the whole impeachment
against Lord Oxford; the upper house, though it had committed
Oxford to the Tower, which seemed to prejudge the question
as to the treasonable character of the imputed offence, having
two years afterwards resolved that the charge of treason should
be first determined, before they would enter on the articles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
less importance; a decision with which the Commons were so
ill satisfied that they declined to go forward with the prosecution.
The resolution of the Peers was hardly conformable to precedent,
to analogy, or to the dignity of the House of Commons, nor will
it perhaps be deemed binding on any future occasion; but the
ministers prudently suffered themselves to be beaten rather
than aggravate the fever of the people by a prosecution so full
of delicate and hazardous questions.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
</p>

<p>One of these questions, and by no means the least important,
would doubtless have arisen upon a mode of defence alleged by
the Earl of Oxford in the house, when the articles of impeachment
were brought up. "My lords," he said, "if ministers of
state, acting by the immediate commands of their sovereign,
are afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings, it
may, one day or other, be the case of all the members of this
august assembly."<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
 It was indeed undeniable that the queen
had been very desirous of peace, and a party, as it were, to all
the counsels that tended to it. Though it was made a charge
against the impeached lords, that the instructions to sign the
secret preliminaries of 1711 with M. Mesnager, on the part of
France, were not under the great seal, nor countersigned by any
minister, they were certainly under the queen's signet, and had
all the authority of her personal command. This must have
brought on the yet unsettled and very delicate question of
ministerial responsibility in matters where the sovereign has
interposed his own command; a question better reserved, it
might then appear, for the loose generalities of debate than to
be determined with the precision of criminal law. Each party,
in fact, had in its turn made use of the queen's personal authority
as a shield; the whigs availed themselves of it to parry the
attack made on their ministry, after its fall, for an alleged mismanagement
of the war in Spain before the battle of Almanza;<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
and the modern constitutional theory was by no means so
established in public opinion as to bear the rude brunt of a
legal argument. Anne herself, like all her predecessors, kept
in her own hands the reins of power; jealous, as such feeble
characters usually are, of those in whom she was forced to
confide (especially after the ungrateful return of the Duchess
of Marlborough for the most affectionate condescension), and
obstinate in her judgment, from the very consciousness of its
weakness, she took a share in all business, frequently presided
in meetings of the cabinet, and sometimes gave directions without
their advice.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
 The defence set up by Lord Oxford would
undoubtedly not be tolerated at present, if alleged in direct
terms, by either house of parliament; however it may sometimes
be deemed a sufficient apology for a minister, by those
whose bias is towards a compliance with power, to insinuate
that he must either obey against his conscience, or resign against
his will.</p>

<p><i>Bill for septennial parliaments.</i>&mdash;Upon this prevalent disaffection,
and the general dangers of the established government,
was founded that measure so frequently arraigned in later times,
the substitution of septennial for triennial parliaments. The
ministry deemed it too perilous for their master, certainly for
themselves, to encounter a general election in 1717; but the
arguments adduced for the alteration, as it was meant to
be permanent, were drawn from its permanent expediency.
Nothing can be more extravagant than what is sometimes confidently
pretended by the ignorant, that the legislature exceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
its rights by this enactment; or, if that cannot legally be advanced,
that it at least violated the trust of the people, and
broke in upon the ancient constitution. The law for triennial
parliaments was of little more than twenty years' continuance.
It was an experiment which, as was argued, had proved unsuccessful;
it was subject, like every other law, to be repealed
entirely, or to be modified at discretion. As a question of constitutional
expediency, the septennial bill was doubtless open
at the time to one serious objection. Every one admitted that
a parliament subsisting indefinitely during a king's life, but
exposed at all times to be dissolved at his pleasure, would
become far too little independent of the people, and far too
much so upon the Crown. But, if the period of its continuance
should thus be extended from three to seven years, the natural
course of encroachment, or some momentous circumstances like
the present, might lead to fresh prolongations, and gradually
to an entire repeal of what had been thought so important a
safeguard of its purity. Time has happily put an end to
apprehensions which are not on that account to be reckoned
unreasonable.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to obtain a return to triennial
parliaments; the most considerable of which was in 1733, when
the powerful talents of Walpole and his opponents were arrayed
on this great question. It has been less debated in modern
times than some others connected with parliamentary reformation.
So long indeed as the sacred duties of choosing the representatives
of a free nation shall be perpetually disgraced by
tumultuary excess, or, what is far worse, by gross corruption
and ruinous profusion (evils which no effectual pains are taken
to redress, and which some apparently desire to perpetuate,
were it only to throw discredit upon the popular part of the
constitution), it would be evidently inexpedient to curtail the
present duration of parliament. But even, independently of
this not insuperable objection, it may well be doubted whether
triennial elections would make much perceptible difference in
the course of government, and whether that difference would
on the whole be beneficial. It will be found, I believe, on a
retrospect of the last hundred years, that the House of Commons
would have acted, in the main, on the same principles, had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
elections been more frequent; and certainly the effects of a
dissolution, when it has occurred in the regular order, have
seldom been very important. It is also to be considered whether
an assembly which so much takes to itself the character of a
deliberative council on all matters of policy, ought to follow
with the precision of a weather-glass the unstable prejudices of
the multitude. There are many who look too exclusively at
the functions of parliament, as the protector of civil liberty
against the Crown; functions, it is true, most important, yet
not more indispensable than those of steering a firm course in
domestic and external affairs, with a circumspectness and providence
for the future, which no wholly democratical government
has ever yet displayed. It is by a middle position between an
oligarchical senate, and a popular assembly, that the House of
Commons is best preserved both in its dignity and usefulness,
subject indeed to swerve towards either character by that
continual variation of forces which act upon the vast machine
of our commonwealth. But what seems more important than
the usual term of duration, is that this should be permitted to
take its course, except in cases where some great change of
national policy may perhaps justify its abridgment. The
Crown would obtain a very serious advantage over the House
of Commons, if it should become an ordinary thing to dissolve
parliament for some petty ministerial interest, or to avert some
unpalatable resolution. Custom appears to have established,
and with some convenience, the substitution of six for seven
years as the natural life of a House of Commons; but an habitual
irregularity in this respect might lead in time to consequences
that most men would deprecate. And it may here be permitted
to express a hope that the necessary dissolution of parliament
within six months of a demise of the Crown will not long be
thought congenial to the spirit of our modern government.</p>

<p><i>Peerage bill.</i>&mdash;A far more unanimous sentence has been pronounced
by posterity upon another great constitutional question,
that arose under George I. Lord Sunderland persuaded
the king to renounce his important prerogative of making peers;
and a bill was supported by the ministry, limiting the House
of Lords, after the creation of a very few more, to its actual
numbers. The Scots were to have twenty-five hereditary,
instead of sixteen elective, members of the house; a provision
neither easily reconciled to the union, nor required by the general
tenor of the bill. This measure was carried with no difficulty
through the upper house, whose interests were so manifestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
concerned in it. But a similar motive, concurring with the
efforts of a powerful malcontent party, caused its rejection by
the Commons.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
 It was justly thought a proof of the king's
ignorance or indifference in everything that concerned his
English Crown, that he should have consented to so momentous
a sacrifice; and Sunderland was reproached for so audacious
an endeavour to strengthen his private faction at the expense
of the fundamental laws of the monarchy. Those who maintained
the expediency of limiting the peerage, had recourse to
uncertain theories as to the ancient constitution, and denied
this prerogative to have been originally vested in the Crown.
A more plausible argument was derived from the abuse, as it
was then generally accounted, of creating at once twelve peers
in the late reign, for the sole end of establishing a majority for
the court; a resource which would be always at the command
of successive factions, till the British nobility might become as
numerous and venal as that of some European states. It was
argued that there was a fallacy in concluding the collective
power of the House of Lords to be augmented by its limitation,
because every single peer would evidently become of more weight
in the kingdom; that the wealth of the whole body must bear
a less proportion to that of the nation, and would possibly not
exceed that of the lower house, while on the other hand it might
be indefinitely multiplied by fresh creations; that the Crown
would lose one great engine of corrupt influence over the
Commons, which could never be truly independent, while its
principal members were looking on it as a stepping-stone to
hereditary honours.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
</p>

<p>Though these reasonings however are not destitute of considerable
weight, and the unlimited prerogative of augmenting
the peerage is liable to such abuses, at least in theory, as might
overthrow our form of government; while, in the opinion of
some, whether erroneous or not, it has actually been exerted
with too little discretion, the arguments against any legal
limitation seem more decisive. The Crown has been carefully
restrained by statutes, and by the responsibility of its advisers;
the Commons, if they transgress their boundaries, are annihilated
by a proclamation; but against the ambition, or, what is
much more likely, the perverse haughtiness of the aristocracy,
the constitution has not furnished such direct securities. And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
as this would be prodigiously enhanced by a consciousness of
their power, and by a sense of self-importance which every peer
would derive from it after the limitation of their numbers, it
might break out in pretensions very galling to the people, and
in an oppressive extension of privileges which were already
sufficiently obnoxious and arbitrary. It is true that the resource
of subduing an aristocratical faction by the creation of new peers
could never be constitutionally employed, except in the case of
a nearly equal balance; but it might usefully hang over the
heads of the whole body, and deter them from any gross excesses
of faction or oligarchical spirit. The nature of our government
requires a general harmony between the two houses of parliament;
and indeed any systematic opposition between them
would of necessity bring on the subordination of one to the other
in too marked a manner; nor had there been wanting within
the memory of man, several instances of such jealous and even
hostile sentiments as could only be allayed by the inconvenient
remedies of a prorogation or a dissolution. These animosities
were likely to revive with more bitterness, when the country
gentlemen and leaders of the commons should come to look on
the nobility as a class into which they could not enter, and the
latter should forget more and more, in their inaccessible dignity,
the near approach of that gentry to themselves in respectability
of birth and extent of possessions.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
</p>

<p>These innovations on the part of the new government were
maintained on the score of its unsettled state, and want of hold
on the national sentiment. It may seem a reproach to the
house of Hanover that, connected as it ought to have been with
the names most dear to English hearts, the protestant religion
and civil liberty, it should have been driven to try the resources
of tyranny, and to demand more authority, to exercise more
control, than had been necessary for the worst of their predecessors.
Much of this disaffection was owing to the cold reserve
of George I., ignorant of the language, alien from the prejudices
of his people, and continually absent in his electoral dominions,
to which he seemed to sacrifice the nation's interest and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
security of his own crown. It is certain that the acquisition
of the duchies of Bremen and Verden for Hanover in 1716
exposed Great Britain to a very serious danger, by provoking
the King of Sweden to join in a league for the restoration of the
Pretender.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
 It might have been impossible (such was the precariousness
of our revolution settlement) to have made the abdication
of the electorate a condition of the house of Brunswick's
succession; but the consequences of that connection, though
much exaggerated by the factious and disaffected, were in various
manners detrimental to English interests during these two reigns;
and not the least in that they estranged the affections of the
people from sovereigns whom they regarded as still foreign.</p>

<p><i>Jacobitism among the clergy.</i>&mdash;The tory and jacobite factions,
as I have observed, were powerful in the church. This had been
the case ever since the revolution. The avowed non-jurors were
busy with the press; and poured forth, especially during the
encouragement they received in part of Anne's reign, a multitude
of pamphlets, sometimes argumentative, more often
virulently libellous. Their idle cry that the church was in
danger, which both houses in 1704 thought fit to deny by a
formal vote, alarmed a senseless multitude. Those who took the
oaths were frequently known partisans of the exiled family;
and those who affected to disclaim that cause, defended the new
settlement with such timid or faithless arms as served only to
give a triumph to the adversary. About the end of William's
reign grew up the distinction of high and low churchmen; the
first distinguished by great pretensions to sacerdotal power,
both spiritual and temporal, by a repugnance to toleration, and
by a firm adherence to the tory principle in the state; the latter
by the opposite characteristics. These were pitched against
each other in the two houses of convocation, an assembly which
virtually ceased to exist under George I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p><i>Convocation.</i>&mdash;The convocation of the province of Canterbury
(for that of York seems never to have been important) is summoned
by the archbishop's writ, under the king's direction, along
with every parliament, to which it bears analogy both in its
constituent parts and in its primary functions. It consists
(since the reformation) of the suffragan bishops, forming the
upper house; of the deans, archdeacons, a proctor or proxy for
each chapter, and two from each diocese, elected by the parochial
clergy, who together constitute the lower house. In this
assembly subsidies were granted, and ecclesiastical canons
enacted. In a few instances under Henry VIII. and Elizabeth,
they were consulted as to momentous questions affecting the
national religion; the supremacy of the former was approved
in 1533, the articles of faith were confirmed in 1562, by the
convocation. But their power to enact fresh canons without
the king's licence, was expressly taken away by a statute of
Henry VIII.; and, even subject to this condition, is limited by
several later acts of parliament (such as the acts of uniformity
under Elizabeth and Charles II., that confirming, and therefore
rendering unalterable, the thirty-nine articles, those relating to
non-residence and other church matters), and still more perhaps
by the doctrine gradually established in Westminster Hall,
that new ecclesiastical canons are not binding on the laity, so
greatly that it will ever be impossible to exercise it in any effectual
manner. The convocation accordingly, with the exception of
1603, when they established some regulations, and of 1640 (an
unfortunate precedent), when they attempted some more, had
little business but to grant subsidies, which, however, were from
the time of Henry VIII. always confirmed by an act of parliament;
an intimation, no doubt, that the legislature did not
wholly acquiesce in their power even of binding the clergy in a
matter of property. This practice of ecclesiastical taxation was
silently discontinued in 1664; at a time when the authority and
pre-eminence of the church stood very high, so that it could not
then have seemed the abandonment of an important privilege.
From this time the clergy have been taxed at the same rate and
in the same manner with the laity.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>It was the natural consequence of this cessation of all business,
that the convocation, after a few formalities, either adjourned
itself or was prorogued by a royal writ; nor had it ever, with the
few exceptions above noticed, sat for more than a few days,
till its supply could be voted. But, about the time of the
revolution, the party most adverse to the new order sedulously
propagated a doctrine that the convocation ought to be advised
with upon all questions affecting the church, and ought even to
watch over its interests as the parliament did over those of the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
 The Commons had so far encouraged this faction
as to refer to the convocation the great question of a reform in
the liturgy for the sake of comprehension, as has been mentioned
in the last chapter; and thus put a stop to the king's design.
It was not suffered to sit much during the rest of that reign, to
the great discontent of its ambitious leaders. The most celebrated
of these, Atterbury, published a book, entitled <i>The
Rights and Privileges of an English Convocation</i>, in answer to
one by Wake, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. The
speciousness of the former, sprinkled with competent learning
on the subject, a graceful style, and an artful employment of
topics, might easily delude, at least, the willing reader. Nothing
indeed could, on reflection, appear more inconclusive than Atterbury's
arguments. Were we even to admit the perfect analogy
of a convocation to a parliament, it could not be doubted that
the king may, legally speaking, prorogue the latter at his
pleasure; and that, if neither money were required to be granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
nor laws to be enacted, a session would be very short. The
church had by prescription a right to be summoned in convocation;
but no prescription could be set up for its longer continuance
than the Crown thought expedient; and it was too
much to expect that William III. was to gratify his half-avowed
enemies, with a privilege of remonstrance and interposition
they had never enjoyed. In the year 1701 the lower house of
convocation pretended to a right of adjourning to a different
day from that fixed by the upper, and consequently of holding
separate sessions. They set up other unprecedented claims to
independence, which were checked by a prorogation.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
 Their
aim was in all respects to assimilate themselves to the House of
Commons, and thus both to set up the convocation itself as an
assembly collateral to parliament, and in the main independent
of it, and to maintain their co-ordinate power and equality in
synodical dignity to the prelates' house. The succeeding reign,
however, began under tory auspices; and the convocation was
in more activity for some years than at any former period. The
lower house of that assembly still distinguished itself by the
most factious spirit, and especially by insolence towards the
bishops, who passed in general for whigs, and whom, while
pretending to assert the divine rights of episcopacy, they laboured
to deprive of that pre-eminence in the Anglican synod which
the ecclesiastical constitution of the kingdom had bestowed on
them.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
 None was more prominent in their debates than Atterbury
himself, whom, in the zenith of tory influence, at the close of
her reign, the queen reluctantly promoted to the see of Rochester.</p>

<p>The new government at first permitted the convocation to
hold its sittings. But they soon excited a flame which consumed
themselves by an attack on Hoadley, Bishop of Bangor, who had
preached a sermon abounding with those principles concerning
religious liberty, of which he had long been the courageous and
powerful assertor.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
 The lower house of convocation thought
fit to denounce, through the report of a committee, the dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
tenets of this discourse, and of a work not long before published
by the bishop. A long and celebrated war of pens instantly
commenced, known by the name of the Bangorian controversy;
managed, perhaps on both sides, with all the chicanery of
polemical writers, and disgusting both from its tediousness, and
from the manifest unwillingness of the disputants to speak
ingenuously what they meant.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
 But, as the principles of
Hoadley and his advocates appeared, in the main, little else
than those of protestantism and toleration, the sentence of the
laity, in the temper that was then gaining ground as to ecclesiastical
subjects, was soon pronounced in their favour; and the
high-church party discredited themselves by an opposition to
what now pass for the incontrovertible truisms of religious
liberty. In the ferment of that age, it was expedient for the
state to scatter a little dust over the angry insects; the convocation
was accordingly prorogued in 1717, and has never
again sat for any business.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
 Those who are imbued with high
notions of sacerdotal power have sometimes deplored this extinction
of the Anglican great council; and though its necessity,
as I have already observed, cannot possibly be defended as an
ancient part of the constitution, there are not wanting specious
arguments for the expediency of such a synod. It might be
urged that the church, considered only as an integral member
of the commonwealth, and the greatest corporation within it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
might justly claim that right of managing its own affairs which
belongs to every other association; that the argument from
abuse is not sufficient, and is rejected with indignation when
applied, as historically it might be, to representative governments
and to civil liberty; that in the present state of things,
no reformation even of secondary importance can be effected
without difficulty, nor any looked for in greater matters, both
from the indifference of the legislature, and the reluctance of the
clergy to admit its interposition.</p>

<p>It is answered to these suggestions, that we must take experience
when we possess it, rather than analogy, for our guide;
that ecclesiastical assemblies have in all ages and countries been
mischievous, where they have been powerful, which that of our
wealthy and numerous clergy must always be; that, notwithstanding,
if the convocation could be brought under the management
of the state (which by the nature of its component parts
might seem not unlikely), it must lead to the promotion of
servile men, and the exclusion of merit still more than at present;
that the severe remark of Clarendon, who observes that of all
mankind none form so bad an estimate of human affairs as
churchmen, is abundantly confirmed by experience; that the
representation of the church in the House of Lords is sufficient
for the protection of its interests; that the clergy have an
influence which no other corporation enjoys over the bulk of
the nation, and are apt to abuse it for the purposes of undue
ascendancy, unjust restraint, or factious ambition; that the
hope of any real good in reformation of the Church by its own
assemblies to whatever sort of reform we may look, is utterly
chimerical; finally, that as the laws now stand, which few would
incline to alter, the ratification of parliament must be indispensable
for any material change. It seems to admit of no
doubt that these reasonings ought much to outweigh those on
the opposite side.</p>

<p><i>Infringements of the toleration by statutes under Anne.</i>&mdash;In the
last four years of the queen's reign, some inroads had been made
on the toleration granted to dissenters, whom the high-church
party held in abhorrence. They had for a long time inveighed
against what was called occasional conformity, or the compliance
of dissenters with the provisions of the test act in order merely
to qualify themselves for holding office, or entering into corporations.
Nothing could, in the eyes of sensible men, be more
advantageous to the church, if a re-union of those who had
separated from it were advantageous, than this practice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Admitting even that the motive was self-interested, has an
established government, in church or state, any better ally
than the self-interestedness of mankind? Was it not what a
presbyterian or independent minister would denounce as a base
and worldly sacrifice? and if so, was not the interest of the
Anglican clergy exactly in an inverse proportion to this? Any
one competent to judge of human affairs would predict, what
has turned out to be the case, that when the barrier was once
taken down for the sake of convenience, it would not be raised
again for conscience; that the most latitudinarian theory, the
most lukewarm dispositions in religion, must be prodigiously
favourable to the reigning sect; and that the dissenting clergy,
though they might retain, or even extend, their influence over
the multitude, would gradually lose it with those classes who
could be affected by the test. But, even if the tory faction had
been cool-headed enough for such reflections, it has, unfortunately,
been sometimes less the aim of the clergy to reconcile
those who differ from them than to keep them in a state of dishonour
and depression. Hence, in the first parliament of Anne,
a bill to prevent occasional conformity more than once passed
the Commons; and, on its being rejected by the Lords, a great
majority of William's bishops voting against the measure, it
was sent up again in a very reprehensible manner, tacked, as it
was called, to a grant of money; so that, according to the pretension
of the Commons in respect to such bills, the upper house
must either refuse the supply, or consent to what they disapproved.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>

This however having miscarried, and the next parliament
being of better principles, nothing farther was done till
1711, when Lord Nottingham, a vehement high-churchman,
having united with the whigs against the treaty of peace, they
were injudicious enough to gratify him by concurring in a bill
to prevent occasional conformity.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
 This was followed up by
the ministry in a more decisive attack on the toleration, an act
for preventing the growth of schism, which extended and confirmed
one of Charles II., enforcing on all schoolmasters, and
even on all teachers in private families, a declaration of conformity
to the established church, to be made before the bishop,
from whom a licence for exercising that profession was also to
be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
 It is impossible to doubt for an instant, that if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the queen's life had preserved the tory government for a few
years, every vestige of the toleration would have been effaced.</p>

<p>These statutes, records of their adversaries' power, the whigs,
now lords of the ascendant, determined to abrogate. The
dissenters were unanimously zealous for the house of Hanover
and for the ministry; the church of very doubtful loyalty to
the Crown, and still less affection to the whig name. In the
session of 1719, accordingly, the act against occasional conformity,
and that restraining education, were repealed.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
 It
had been the intention to have also repealed the test act; but
the disunion then prevailing among the whigs had caused so
formidable an opposition even to the former measures, that it
was found necessary to abandon that project. Walpole, more
cautious and moderate than the ministry of 1719, perceived
the advantage of reconciling the church as far as possible to
the royal family and to his own government; and it seems to
have been an article in the tacit compromise with the bishops,
who were not backward in exerting their influence for the
Crown, that he should make no attempt to abrogate the laws
which gave a monopoly of power to the Anglican communion.
We may presume also that the prelates undertook not to obstruct
the acts of indemnity passed from time to time in favour
of those who had not duly qualified themselves for the offices
they held; and which, after some time becoming regular, have
in effect thrown open the gates to protestant dissenters, though
still subject to be closed by either house of parliament, if any
jealousies should induce them to refuse their assent to this
annual enactment.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Principles of toleration fully established.</i>&mdash;Meanwhile the principles
of religious liberty, in all senses of the word, gained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
strength by this eager controversy, naturally pleasing as they
are to the proud independence of the English character, and
congenial to those of civil freedom, which both parties, tory as
much as whig, had now learned sedulously to maintain. The
non-juring and high-church factions among the clergy produced
few eminent men; and lost credit, not more by the folly of their
notions than by their general want of scholarship and disregard
of their duties. The university of Oxford was tainted to the
core with jacobite prejudices; but it must be added that it
never stood so low in respectability as a place of education.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>

The government, on the other hand, was studious to promote
distinguished men; and doubtless the hierarchy in the first
sixty years of the eighteenth century might very advantageously
be compared, in point of conspicuous ability, with that of any
equal period that ensued. The maxims of persecution were
silently abandoned, as well as its practice; Warburton, and
others of less name, taught those of toleration with as much
boldness as Hoadley, but without some of his more invidious
tenets; the more popular writers took a liberal tone; the names
of Locke and Montesquieu acquired immense authority; the
courts of justice discountenanced any endeavour to revive
oppressive statutes; and, not long after the end of George the
Second's reign, it was adjudged in the House of Lords, upon the
broadest principles of toleration laid down by Lord Mansfield,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
that nonconformity with the established church is recognised
by the law, and not an offence at which it connives.</p>

<p><i>Banishment of Atterbury.</i>&mdash;Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester,
the most distinguished of the party denominated high-church,
became the victim of his restless character and implacable disaffection
to the house of Hanover. The pretended king, for
some years after his competitor's accession, had fair hopes from
different powers of Europe&mdash;France, Sweden, Russia, Spain,
Austria&mdash;(each of whom, in its turn, was ready to make use of
this instrument), and from the powerful faction who panted
for his restoration. This was unquestionably very numerous;
though we have not as yet the means of fixing with certainty
on more than comparatively a small number of names. But a
conspiracy for an invasion from Spain and a simultaneous rising
was detected in 1722, which implicated three or four peers, and
among them the Bishop of Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
 The evidence, however,
though tolerably convincing, being insufficient for a verdict at
law, it was thought expedient to pass a bill of pains and penalties
against this prelate, as well as others against two of his accomplices.
The proof, besides many corroborating circumstances,
consisted in three letters relative to the conspiracy, supposed
to be written by his secretary Kelly, and appearing to be
dictated by the bishop. He was deprived of his see, and
banished the kingdom for life.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
 This met with strong opposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
not limited to the enemies of the royal family, and is open
to the same objection as the attainder of Sir John Fenwick;
the danger of setting aside those precious securities against a
wicked government which the law of treason has furnished. As
a vigorous assertion of the state's authority over the church we
may commend the policy of Atterbury's deprivation; but perhaps
this was ill purchased by a mischievous precedent. It is
however the last act of a violent nature in any important matter,
which can be charged against the English legislature.</p>

<p><i>Decline of the Jacobites.</i>&mdash;No extensive conspiracy of the
jacobite faction seems ever to have been in agitation after the
fall of Atterbury. The Pretender had his emissaries perpetually
alert; and it is understood that an enormous mass of letters
from his English friends is in existence;<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
 but very few had the
courage, or rather folly, to plunge into so desperate a course as
rebellion. Walpole's prudent and vigilant administration, without
transgressing the boundaries of that free constitution for
which alone the house of Brunswick had been preferred, kept
in check the disaffected. He wisely sought the friendship of
Cardinal Fleury, aware that no other power in Europe than
France could effectually assist the banished family. After his
own fall and the death of Fleury, new combinations of foreign
policy arose; his successors returned to the Austrian connection;
a war with France broke out; the grandson of James II. became
master, for a moment, of Scotland, and even advanced to the
centre of this peaceful and unprotected kingdom. But this was
hardly more ignominious to the government than to the jacobites
themselves; none of them joined the standard of their pretended
sovereign; and the rebellion of 1745 was conclusive, by its own
temporary success, against the possibility of his restoration.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
From this time the government, even when in search of pretexts
for alarm, could hardly affect to dread a name grown so contemptible
as that of the Stuart party. It survived however for
the rest of the reign of George II. in those magnanimous compotations,
which had always been the best evidence of its
courage and fidelity.</p>

<p><i>Prejudices against the reigning family.</i>&mdash;Though the jacobite
party had set before its eyes an object most dangerous to the
public tranquillity, and which, could it have been attained,
would have brought on again the contention of the seventeenth
century; though, in taking oaths to a government against
which they were in conspiracy, they showed a systematic disregard
of obligation, and were as little mindful of allegiance, in
the years 1715 and 1745, to the prince they owned in their
hearts, as they had been to him whom they had professed to
acknowledge, it ought to be admitted that they were rendered
more numerous and formidable than was necessary by the faults
of the reigning kings or of their ministers. They were not
actuated for the most part (perhaps with very few exceptions)
by the slavish principles of indefeasible right, much less by those
of despotic power. They had been so long in opposition to the
court, they had so often spoken the language of liberty, that we
may justly believe them to have been its friends. It was the
policy of Walpole to keep alive the strongest prejudice in the
mind of George II., obstinately retentive of prejudice, as such
narrow and passionate minds always are, against the whole body
of the tories. They were ill received at court, and generally
excluded, not only from those departments of office which the
dominant party have a right to keep in their power, but from
the commission of the peace, and every other subordinate trust.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>

This illiberal and selfish course retained many, no doubt, in the
Pretender's camp, who must have perceived both the improbability
of his restoration, and the difficulty of reconciling it
with the safety of our constitution. He was indeed, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
his son, far less worthy of respect than the contemporary Brunswick
kings: without absolutely wanting capacity or courage, he
gave the most undeniable evidence of his legitimacy by constantly
resisting the counsels of wise men, and yielding to those
of priests; while his son, the fugitive of Culloden, despised and
deserted by his own party, insulted by the court of France, lost
with the advance of years even the respect and compassion
which wait on unceasing misfortune, the last sad inheritance of
the house of Stuart.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
 But they were little known in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
and from unknown princes men are prone to hope much: if
some could anticipate a redress of every evil from Frederic
Prince of Wales, whom they might discover to be destitute of
respectable qualities, it cannot be wondered at that others
might draw equally flattering prognostics from the accession of
Charles Edward. It is almost certain that, if either the claimant
or his son had embraced the protestant religion, and had also
manifested any superior strength of mind, the German prejudices
of the reigning family would have cost them the throne,
as they did the people's affections. Jacobitism, in the great
majority, was one modification of the spirit of liberty burning
strongly in the nation at this period. It gave a rallying point
to that indefinite discontent, which is excited by an ill opinion
of rulers, and to that disinterested, though ignorant patriotism
which boils up in youthful minds. The government in possession
was hated, not as usurped, but as corrupt; the banished
line was demanded, not so much because it was legitimate, but
because it was the fancied means of redressing grievances and
regenerating the constitution. Such notions were doubtless
absurd; but it is undeniable that they were common, and had
been so almost from the revolution. I speak only, it will be
observed, of the English jacobites; in Scotland the sentiments of
loyalty and national pride had a vital energy, and the Highland
chieftains gave their blood, as freely as their southern allies did
their wine, for the cause of their ancient kings.</p>

<p>No one can have looked in the most cursory manner at the
political writings of these two reigns, or at the debates of parliament,
without being struck by the continual predictions that
our liberties were on the point of extinguishment, or at least
by apprehensions of their being endangered. It might seem
that little or nothing had been gained by the revolution, and
by the substitution of an elective dynasty. This doubtless it
was the interest of the Stuart party to maintain or insinuate;
and, in the conflict of factions, those who, with far opposite
views, had separated from the court, seemed to lend them aid.
The declamatory exaggerations of that able and ambitious body
of men who co-operated against the ministry of Sir Robert
Walpole have long been rejected; and perhaps in the usual
reflux of popular opinion, his domestic administration (for in
foreign policy his views, so far as he was permitted to act upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
them, appear to have been uniformly judicious) has obtained
of late rather an undue degree of favour. I have already
observed that, for the sake of his own ascendancy in the cabinet,
he kept up unnecessarily the distinctions of the whig and tory
parties, and thus impaired the stability of the royal house,
which it was his chief care to support. And, though his government
was so far from anything oppressive or arbitrary that,
considered either relatively to any former times, or to the extensive
disaffection known to subsist, it was uncommonly moderate;
yet, feeling or feigning alarm at the jacobite intrigues on the
one hand, at the democratic tone of public sentiment and of
popular writings on the other, he laboured to preserve a more
narrow and oligarchical spirit than was congenial to so great
and brave a people, and trusted not enough, as indeed is the
general fault of ministers, to the sway of good sense and honesty
over disinterested minds. But, as he never had a complete
influence over his master, and knew that those who opposed
him had little else in view than to seize the reins of power and
manage them worse, his deviations from the straight course are
more pardonable.</p>

<p>The clamorous invectives of this opposition, combined with
the subsequent dereliction of avowed principles by many among
them when in power, contributed more than anything else in
our history to cast obloquy and suspicion, or even ridicule, on
the name and occupation of patriots. Men of sordid and venal
characters always rejoice to generalise so convenient a maxim
as the non-existence of public virtue. It may not however be
improbable, that many of those who took a part in this long
contention, were less insincere than it has been the fashion to
believe, though led too far at the moment by their own passions,
as well as by the necessity of colouring highly a picture meant
for the multitude, and reduced afterwards to the usual compromises
and concessions, without which power in this country is
ever unattainable. But waiving a topic too generally historical
for the present chapter, it will be worth while to consider what
sort of ground there might be for some prevalent subjects of
declamation; and whether the power of government had not,
in several respects, been a good deal enhanced since the beginning
of the century. By the power of government I mean not
so much the personal authority of the sovereign as that of his
ministers, acting perhaps without his directions; which, since
the reign of William, is to be distinguished, if we look at it
analytically, from the monarchy itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>I. The most striking acquisition of power by the Crown in
the new model of government, if I may use such an expression,
is the permanence of a regular military force. The reader
cannot need to be reminded that no army existed before the
civil war, that the guards in the reign of Charles II. were about
5000 men, that in the breathing-time between the peace of
Ryswick and the war of the Spanish succession, the Commons
could not be brought to keep up more than 7000 troops. Nothing
could be more repugnant to the national prejudices than
a standing army. The tories, partly from regard to the ancient
usage of the constitution, partly, no doubt, from a factious or
disaffected spirit, were unanimous in protesting against it. The
most disinterested and zealous lovers of liberty came with great
suspicion and reluctance into what seemed so perilous an innovation.
But the court, after the accession of the house of
Hanover, had many reasons for insisting upon so great an
augmentation of its power and security. It is remarkable to
perceive by what stealthy advances this came on. Two long
wars had rendered the army a profession for men in the higher
and middling classes, and familiarised the nation to their dress
and rank; it had achieved great honour for itself and the
English name; and in the nature of mankind the patriotism
of glory is too often an overmatch for that of liberty. The two
kings were fond of warlike policy, the second of war itself;
their schemes, and those of their ministers, demanded an imposing
attitude in negotiation, which an army, it was thought,
could best give; the cabinet was for many years entangled in
alliances, shifting sometimes rapidly, but in each combination
liable to produce the interruption of peace. In the new system
which rendered the houses of parliament partakers in the executive
administration, they were drawn themselves into the approbation
of every successive measure, either on the propositions of
ministers, or as often happens more indirectly, but hardly less
effectually, by passing a negative on those of their opponents.</p>

<p><i>Permanent military force.</i>&mdash;The number of troops for which
a vote was annually demanded, after some variations, in the
first years of George I., was, during the whole administration
of Sir Robert Walpole, except when the state of Europe excited
some apprehension of disturbance, rather more than 17,000
men, independent of those on the Irish establishment, but
including the garrisons of Minorca and Gibraltar. And this
continued with little alteration to be our standing army in time
of peace during the eighteenth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>This army was always understood to be kept on foot, as it is
still expressed in the preamble of every mutiny bill, for better
preserving the balance of power in Europe. The Commons
would not for an instant admit that it was necessary as a
permanent force, in order to maintain the government at home.
There can be no question however that the court saw its advantage
in this light; and I am not perfectly sure that some of the
multiplied negotiations on the continent in that age were not
intended as a pretext for keeping up the army, or at least as a
means of exciting alarm for the security of the established
government. In fact, there would have been rebellions in the
time of George I., not only in Scotland, which perhaps could
not otherwise have been preserved, but in many parts of the
kingdom, had the parliament adhered with too pertinacious
bigotry to their ancient maxims. Yet these had such influence
that it was long before the army was admitted by every one to
be perpetual; and I do not know that it has ever been recognised
as such in our statutes. Mr. Pulteney, so late as 1732, a man
neither disaffected nor democratical, and whose views extended
no farther than a change of hands, declared that he "always
had been, and always would be, against a standing army of any
kind; it was to him a terrible thing, whether under the denomination
of parliamentary or any other. A standing army is still
a standing army, whatever name it be called by; they are a
body of men distinct from the body of the people; they are
governed by different laws; blind obedience and an entire submission
to the orders of their commanding officer is their only
principle. The nations around us are already enslaved, and
have been enslaved by those very means; by means of their
standing armies they have every one lost their liberties; it is
indeed impossible that the liberties of the people can be preserved
in any country where a numerous standing army is
kept up."<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
</p>

<p>This wholesome jealousy, though it did not prevent what
was indeed for many reasons not to be dispensed with, the
establishment of a regular force, kept it within bounds which
possibly the administration, if left to itself, would have gladly
overleaped. A clause in the mutiny bill, first inserted in 1718,
enabling courts-martial to punish mutiny and desertion with
death, which had hitherto been only cognisable as capital
offences by the civil magistrate, was carried by a very small
majority in both houses.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
 An act was passed in 1735, directing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
that no troops should come within two miles of any place,
except the capital or a garrisoned town, during an election;<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>

and on some occasions, both the Commons and the courts of
justice showed that they had not forgotten the maxims of their
ancestors as to the supremacy of the civil power.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
 A more
important measure was projected by men of independent principles,
at once to secure the kingdom against attack, invaded
as it had been by rebels in 1745, and thrown into the most
ignominious panic on the rumours of a French armament in
1756, to take away the pretext for a large standing force, and
perhaps to furnish a guarantee against any evil purposes to
which in future times it might be subservient, by the establishment
of a national militia, under the sole authority, indeed of
the Crown, but commanded by gentlemen of sufficient estates,
and not liable, except in war, to be marched out of its proper
county. This favourite plan, with some reluctance on the part
of the government, was adopted in 1757.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
 But though, during
the long periods of hostilities which have unfortunately ensued,
this embodied force had doubtless placed the kingdom in a
more respectable state of security, it has not much contributed
to diminish the number of our regular forces; and, from some
defects in its constitution, arising out of too great attention to
our ancient local divisions, and of too indiscriminate a dispensation
with personal service, which has filled the ranks with the
refuse of the community, the militia has grown unpopular and
burthensome, rather considered of late by the government as a
means of recruiting the army than as worthy of preservation in
itself, and accordingly thrown aside in time of peace; so that
the person who acquired great popularity as the author of this
institution, lived to see it worn out and gone to decay, and the
principles, above all, upon which he had brought it forward,
just enough remembered to be turned into ridicule. Yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
success of that magnificent organisation which, in our own time,
has been established in France, is sufficient to evince the possibility
of a national militia; and we know with what spirit such
a force was kept up for some years in this country, under the
name of volunteers and yeomanry, on its only real basis, that
of property, and in such local distribution as convenience pointed
out.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more idle, at any time since the revolution,
than to suppose that the regular army would pull the speaker
out of his chair, or in any manner be employed to confirm a
despotic power in the Crown. Such power, I think, could never
have been the waking dream of either king or minister. But
as the slightest inroads upon private rights and liberties are to
be guarded against in any nation that deserves to be called free,
we should always keep in mind not only that the military power
is subordinate to the civil, but, as this subordination must cease
where the former is frequently employed, that it should never
be called upon in aid of the peace without sufficient cause.
Nothing would more break down this notion of the law's supremacy
than the perpetual interference of those who are really
governed by another law; for the doctrine of some judges, that
the soldier, being still a citizen, acts only in preservation of the
public peace, as another citizen is bound to do, must be felt as
a sophism, even by those who cannot find an answer to it.
And, even in slight circumstances, it is not conformable to the
principles of our government to make that vain display of
military authority which disgusts us so much in some continental
kingdoms. But, not to dwell on this, it is more to our
immediate purpose that the executive power has acquired such
a coadjutor in the regular army that it can, in no probable
emergency, have much to apprehend from popular sedition.
The increased facilities of transport, and several improvements
in military art and science, which will occur to the reader, have
in later times greatly enhanced this advantage.</p>

<p>II. It must be apparent to every one that since the restoration,
and especially since the revolution, an immense power has
been thrown into the scale of both houses of parliament, though
practically in more frequent exercise by the lower, in consequence
of their annual session during several months, and of their almost
unlimited rights of investigation, discussion, and advice. But, if
the Crown should by any means become secure of an ascendancy
in this assembly, it is evident that, although the prerogative,
technically speaking, might be diminished, the power might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the same, or even possibly more efficacious; and that this result
must be proportioned to the degree and security of such an
ascendancy. A parliament absolutely, and in all conceivable
circumstances, under the control of the sovereign, whether
through intimidation or corrupt subservience, could not, without
absurdity, be deemed a co-ordinate power, or, indeed, in any
sense, a restraint upon his will. This is however an extreme
supposition, which no man, unless both grossly factious and
ignorant, will ever pretend to have been realised. But, as it
would equally contradict notorious truth to assert that every
vote has been disinterested and independent, the degree of
influence which ought to be permitted, or which has at any
time existed, becomes one of the most important subjects in
our constitutional policy.</p>

<p>I have mentioned in the last chapter both the provisions
inserted in the act of settlement, with the design of excluding
altogether the possessors of public office from the House of
Commons, and the modifications of them by several acts of the
queen. These were deemed by the country party so inadequate
to restrain the dependents of power from overspreading the
benches of the Commons that perpetual attempts were made
to carry the exclusive principle to a far greater length. In the
two next reigns, if we can trust to the uncontradicted language
of debate, or even to the descriptions of individuals in the lists
of each parliament, we must conclude that a very undue proportion
of dependents on the favour of government were made
its censors and counsellors. There was still, however, so much
left of an independent spirit, that bills for restricting the number
of placemen, or excluding pensioners, met always with countenance;
they were sometimes rejected by very slight majorities;
and, after a time, Sir Robert Walpole found it expedient to
reserve his opposition for the surer field of the other house.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
After his fall, it was imputed with some justice to his successors,
that they shrunk in power from the bold reformation which they
had so frequently endeavoured; the king was indignantly averse
to all retrenchment of his power, and they wanted probably
both the inclination and the influence to cut off all corruption.
Yet we owe to this ministry the place bill of 1743, which, derided
as it was at the time, seems to have had a considerable effect;
excluding a great number of inferior officers from the House of
Commons, which has never since contained so revolting a list of
court-deputies as it did in the age of Walpole.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Secret corruption.</i>&mdash;But while this acknowledged influence of
lucrative office might be presumed to operate on many staunch
adherents of the actual administration, there was always a
strong suspicion, or rather a general certainty, of absolute
corruption. The proofs in single instances could never perhaps
be established; which, of course, is not surprising. But no one
seriously called in question the reality of a systematic distribution
of money by the Crown to the representatives of the people;
nor did the corrupters themselves, in whom the crime seems
always to be deemed less heinous, disguise it in private.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
 It is
true that the appropriation of supplies, and the established
course of the exchequer, render the greatest part of the public
revenue secure from misapplication; but, under the head of
secret service money, a very large sum was annually expended
without account, and some other parts of the civil list were
equally free from all public examination.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
 The committee of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
secrecy appointed after the resignation of Sir Robert Walpole
endeavoured to elicit some distinct evidence of this misapplication;
but the obscurity natural to such transactions, and the
guilty collusion of subaltern accomplices, who shrouded themselves
in the protection of the law, defeated every hope of
punishment, or even personal disgrace.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
 This practice of direct
bribery continued, beyond doubt, long afterwards, and is
generally supposed to have ceased about the termination of the
American war.</p>

<p>There is hardly any doctrine with respect to our government
more in fashion than that a considerable influence of the Crown
(meaning of course a corrupt influence) in both houses of
parliament, and especially in the Commons, has been rendered
indispensable by the vast enhancement of their own power
over the public administration. It is doubtless most expedient
that many servants of the Crown should be also servants of the
people; and no man who values the constitution would separate
the functions of ministers of state from those of legislators.
The glory that waits on wisdom and eloquence in the senate
should always be the great prize of an English statesman, and
his high road to the sovereign's favour. But the maxim that
private vices are public benefits is as sophistical as it is disgusting;
and it is self-evident, both that the expectation of a
clandestine recompense, or what in effect is the same thing, of
a lucrative office, cannot be the motive of an upright man in his
vote, and that if an entire parliament should be composed of
such venal spirits, there would be an end of all control upon the
Crown. There is no real cause to apprehend that a virtuous
and enlightened government would find difficulty in resting upon
the reputation justly due to it; especially when we throw into
the scale that species of influence which must ever subsist, the
sentiment of respect and loyalty to a sovereign, of friendship
and gratitude to a minister, of habitual confidence in those
intrusted with power, of averseness to confusion and untried
change, which have in fact more extensive operation than any
sordid motives, and which must almost always render them
unnecessary.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>III. <i>Commitments for breach of privilege.</i>&mdash;The co-operation
of both houses of parliament with the executive government
enabled the latter to convert to its own purpose what had often
in former times been employed against it, the power of inflicting
punishment for breach of privilege. But as the subject of
parliamentary privilege is of no slight importance, it will be
convenient on this occasion to bring the whole before the reader
in as concise a summary as possible, distinguishing the power,
as it relates to offences committed by members of either house,
or against them singly, or the houses of parliament collectively,
or against the government and the public.</p>

<p>1. It has been the constant practice of the House of Commons
to repress disorderly or indecent behaviour by a censure delivered
through the speaker. Instances of this are even noticed in the
journals under Edward VI. and Mary; and it is in fact essential
to the regular proceedings of any assembly. In the former reign
they also committed one of their members to the Tower. But in
the famous case of Arthur Hall in 1581, they established the first
precedent of punishing one of their own body for a printed libel
derogatory to them as a part of the legislature; and they inflicted
the threefold penalty of imprisonment, fine, and expulsion.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>

From this time forth it was understood to be the law and usage
of parliament, that the Commons might commit to prison any
one of their members for misconduct in the house, or relating to
it. The right of imposing a fine was very rarely asserted after
the instance of Hall. But that of expulsion, no earlier precedent
whereof has been recorded, became as indubitable as frequent
and unquestioned usage could render it. It was carried to a
great excess by the long parliament, and again in the year 1680.
These, however, were times of extreme violence; and the prevailing
faction had an apology in the designs of the court, which
required an energy beyond the law to counteract them. The
offences, too, which the whigs thus punished in 1680, were in
their effect against the power and even existence of parliament.
The privilege was far more unwarrantably exerted by the
opposite party in 1714, against Sir Richard Steele, expelled the
house for writing the "Crisis," a pamphlet reflecting on the
ministry. This was, perhaps, the first instance wherein the
House of Commons so identified itself with the executive
administration, independently of the sovereign's person, as to
consider itself libelled by those who impugned its measures.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>In a few instances an attempt was made to carry this farther,
by declaring the party incapable of sitting in parliament. It
is hardly necessary to remark that upon this rested the celebrated
question of the Middlesex election in 1769. If a few precedents,
and those not before the year 1680, were to determine all controversies
of constitutional law, it is plain enough from the
journals that the house have assumed the power of incapacitation.
But as such an authority is highly dangerous and unnecessary
for any good purpose, and as, according to all legal rules, so
extraordinary a power could not be supported except by a sort
of prescription which cannot be shown, the final resolution of
the House of Commons, which condemned the votes passed in
times of great excitement, appears far more consonant to just
principles.</p>

<p>2. The power of each house of parliament over those who do
not belong to it is of a more extensive consideration, and has lain
open, in some respects, to more doubt than that over its own
members. It has been exercised, in the first place, very frequently,
and from an early period, in order to protect the members
personally, and in their properties, from anything which has
been construed to interfere with the discharge of their functions.
Every obstruction in these duties, by assaulting, challenging,
insulting any single representative of the Commons, has from
the middle of the sixteenth century downwards, that is, from
the beginning of their regular journals, been justly deemed a
breach of privilege, and an offence against the whole body. It
has been punished generally by commitment, either to the
custody of the house's officer, the serjeant-at-arms, or to the
king's prison. This summary proceeding is usually defended
by a technical analogy to what are called attachments for
contempt, by which every court of record is entitled to punish
by imprisonment, if not also by fine, any obstruction to its acts
or contumacious resistance of them. But it tended also to raise
the dignity of parliament in the eyes of the people, at times
when the government, and even the courts of justice, were not
greatly inclined to regard it; and has been also a necessary safeguard
against the insolence of power. The majority are bound
to respect, and indeed have respected, the rights of every
member, however obnoxious to them, on all questions of privilege.
Even in the case most likely to occur in the present age, that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
libels, which by no unreasonable stretch come under the head of
obstructions, it would be unjust that a patriotic legislator,
exposed to calumny for his zeal in the public cause, should be
necessarily driven to a troublesome and uncertain process at
law, when the offence so manifestly affects the real interests of
parliament and the nation. The application of this principle
must of course require a discreet temper, which was not perhaps
always observed in former times, especially in the reign of
William III. Instances at least of punishment for breach of
privilege by personal reflections are never so common as in the
journals of that turbulent period.</p>

<p>The most usual mode, however, of incurring the animadversion
of the house was by molestations in regard to property.
It was the most ancient privilege of the Commons to be free
from all legal process, during the term of the session and for
forty days before and after, except on charges of treason, felony,
or breach of the peace. I have elsewhere mentioned the great
case of Ferrers, under Henry VIII., wherein the house first, as
far as we know, exerted the power of committing to prison those
who had been concerned in arresting one of its members; and
have shown that, after some little intermission, this became
their recognised and customary right. Numberless instances
occur of its exercise.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
 It was not only a breach of privilege to
serve any sort of process upon them, but to put them under the
necessity of seeking redress at law for any civil injury. Thus
abundant cases are found in the journals, where persons have
been committed to prison for entering on the estates of members,
carrying away timber, lopping trees, digging coal, fishing in
their waters. Their servants, and even their tenants, if the
trespass were such as to affect the landlord's property, had the
same protection.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
 The grievance of so unparalleled an immunity
must have been notorious, since it not only suspended
at least the redress of creditors, but enabled rapacious men to
establish in some measure unjust claims in respect of property;
the alleged trespasses being generally founded on some disputed
right. An act however was passed, rendering the members of
both houses liable to civil suits during the prorogation of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>

But they long continued to avenge the private injuries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
real or pretended, of their members. On a complaint of breach
of privilege by trespassing on a fishery (Jan. 25, 1768), they
heard evidence on both sides, and determined that no breach of
privilege had been committed; thus indirectly taking on them
the decision of a freehold right. A few days after they came
to a resolution, "that in case of any complaint of a breach
of privilege, hereafter to be made by any member of this
house, if the house shall adjudge there is no ground for such
complaint, the house will order satisfaction to the person
complained of for his costs and expenses incurred by reason
of such complaint."<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
 But little opportunity was given to try
the effect of this resolution, an act having passed in two years
afterwards, which has altogether taken away the exemption
from legal process, except as to the immunity from personal
arrest, which still continues to be the privilege of both houses
of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
</p>

<p>3. A more important class of offences against privilege is of
such as affect either house of parliament collectively. In the
reign of Elizabeth we have an instance of one committed for
disrespectful words against the Commons. A few others, either
for words spoken or published libels, occur in the reign of Charles
I. even before the long parliament; but those of 1641 can have
little weight as precedents, and we may say nearly the same of
the unjustifiable proceedings in 1680. Even since the revolution
we find too many proofs of encroaching pride or intemperate
passion, to which a numerous assembly is always prone, and
which the prevalent doctrine of the house's absolute power in
matters of privilege has not contributed much to restrain. The
most remarkable may be briefly noticed.</p>

<p>The Commons of 1701, wherein a tory spirit was strongly
predominant, by what were deemed its factious delays in voting
supplies, and in seconding the measures of the king for the
security of Europe, had exasperated all those who saw the
nation's safety in vigorous preparations for war, and led at last
to the most angry resolution of the Lords, which one house of
parliament in a matter not affecting its privileges has ever
recorded against the other.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
 The grand jury of Kent, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
freeholders of the county, presented accordingly a petition on
the 8th of May 1701, imploring them to turn their loyal addresses
into bills of supply (the only phrase in the whole petition that
could be construed into disrespect), and to enable his majesty
to assist his allies before it should be too late. The tory faction
was wrought to fury by this honest remonstrance. They voted
that the petition was scandalous, insolent, and seditious, tending
to destroy the constitution of parliament, and to subvert the
established government of this realm; and ordered that Mr.
Colepepper, who had been most forward in presenting the
petition, and all others concerned in it, should be taken into
custody of the serjeant.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
 Though no attempt was made on
this occasion to call the authority of the house into question
by habeas corpus or other legal remedy, it was discussed in
pamphlets and in general conversation, with little advantage
to a power so arbitrary, and so evidently abused in the
immediate instance.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>A very few years after this high exercise of authority, it was
called forth in another case, still more remarkable and even less
warrantable. The House of Commons had an undoubted right
of determining all disputed returns to the writ of election, and
consequently of judging upon the right of every vote. But,
as the house could not pretend that it had given this right, or
that it was not, like any other franchise, vested in the possessor
by a legal title, no pretext of reason or analogy could be set up
for denying that it might also come, in an indirect manner at
least, before a court of justice, and be judged by the common
principles of law. One Ashby, however, a burgess of Aylesbury,
having sued the returning officer for refusing his vote; and three
judges of the king's bench, against the opinion of Chief-Justice
Holt, having determined for different reasons that it did not lie,
a writ of error was brought in the House of Lords, when the
judgment was reversed. The House of Commons took this up
indignantly, and passed various resolutions, asserting their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
exclusive right to take cognisance of all matters relating to the
election of their members. The Lords repelled these by contrary
resolutions; That by the known laws of this kingdom, every
person having a right to give his vote, and being wilfully denied
by the officer who ought to receive it, may maintain an action
against such officer to recover damage for the injury; That the
contrary assertion is destructive of the property of the subject,
and tends to encourage corruption and partiality in returning
officers; That the declaring persons guilty of breach of privilege
for prosecuting such actions, or for soliciting and pleading in
them, is a manifest assuming a power to control the law, and
hinder the course of justice, and subject the property of Englishmen
to the arbitrary votes of the House of Commons. They
ordered a copy of these resolutions to be sent to all the sheriffs,
and to be communicated by them to all the boroughs in their
respective counties.</p>

<p>A prorogation soon afterwards followed, but served only to
give breathing time to the exasperated parties; for it must be
observed, that though a sense of dignity and privilege no doubt
swelled the majorities in each house, the question was very
much involved in the general whig and tory course of politics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
But Ashby, during the recess, having proceeded to execution on
his judgment, and some other actions having been brought
against the returning officer of Aylesbury, the Commons again
took it up, and committed the parties to Newgate. They moved
the court of king's bench for a habeas corpus; upon the return
to which, the judges, except Holt, thought themselves not
warranted to set them at liberty against the commitment of the
house.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
 It was threatened to bring this by writ of error before
the Lords; and, in the disposition of that assembly, it seems
probable that they would have inflicted a severe wound on the
privileges of the lower house, which must in all probability have
turned out a sort of suicide upon their own. But the Commons
interposed by resolving to commit to prison the counsel and
agents concerned in prosecuting the habeas corpus, and by
addressing the queen not to grant a writ of error. The queen
properly answered, that as this matter, relating to the course of
judicial proceedings, was of the highest consequence, she thought
it necessary to weigh very carefully what she should do. The
Lords came to some important resolutions: That neither house
of parliament hath any power by any vote or declaration to
create to themselves any new privilege that is not warranted by
the known laws and customs of parliament; That the House
of Commons, in committing to Newgate certain persons for
prosecuting an action at law, upon pretence that their so doing
was contrary to a declaration, a contempt of the jurisdiction,
and a breach of the privileges of that house, have assumed to
themselves alone a legislative power, by pretending to attribute
the force of law to their declaration, have claimed a jurisdiction
not warranted by the constitution, and have assumed a new
privilege, to which they can show no title by the law and custom
of parliament; and have thereby, as far as in them lies, subjected
the rights of Englishmen, and the freedom of their persons, to the
arbitrary votes of the House of Commons; That every Englishman,
who is imprisoned by any authority whatsoever, has an
undoubted right to a writ of habeas corpus, in order to obtain
his liberty by the due course of law; That for the House of
Commons to punish any person for assisting a prisoner to procure
such a writ is an attempt of dangerous consequence, and a breach
of the statutes provided for the liberty of the subject; That a
writ of error is not of grace but of right, and ought not to be
denied to the subject when duly applied for, though at the
request of either house of parliament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>These vigorous resolutions produced a conference between
the houses, which was managed with more temper than might
have been expected from the tone taken on both sides. But,
neither of them receding in the slightest degree, the Lords
addressed the queen, requesting her to issue the writs of error
demanded upon the refusal of the king's bench to discharge
the parties committed by the House of Commons. The queen
answered the same day, that she should have granted the writs
of error desired by them, but finding an absolute necessity of
putting an immediate end to the session, she was sensible there
could have been no further proceeding upon them. The meaning
of this could only be, that by a prorogation all commitments
by order of the lower house of parliament are determined, so
that the parties could stand in no need of a habeas corpus. But
a great constitutional question was thus wholly eluded.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
</p>

<p>We may reckon the proceedings against Mr. Alexander
Murray, in 1751, among the instances wherein the House of
Commons has been hurried by passion to an undue violence.
This gentleman had been active in a contested Westminster
election, on an anti-ministerial and perhaps jacobite interest.
In the course of an inquiry before the house, founded on a
petition against the return, the high-bailiff named Mr. Murray
as having insulted him in the execution of his duty. The house
resolved to hear Murray by counsel in his defence, and the high-bailiff
also by counsel in support of the charge, and ordered the
former to give bail for his appearance from time to time. These,
especially the last, were innovations on the practice of parliament,
and were justly opposed by the more cool-headed men.
After hearing witnesses on both sides, it was resolved that
Murray should be committed to Newgate, and should receive
this sentence upon his knees. This command he steadily
refused to obey, and thus drew on himself a storm of wrath at
such insolence and audacity. But the times were no more,
when the Commons could inflict whippings and pillories on the
refractory; and they were forced to content themselves with
ordering that no person should be admitted to him in prison,
which, on account of his ill-health, they soon afterwards relaxed.
The public voice is never favourable to such arbitrary exertions
of mere power: at the expiration of the session, Mr. Murray,
thus grown from an intriguing jacobite into a confessor of
popular liberty, was attended home by a sort of triumphal
procession amidst the applause of the people. In the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
session he was again committed on the same charge; a proceeding
extremely violent and arbitrary.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
</p>

<p>It has been always deemed a most important and essential
privilege of the houses of parliament, that they may punish in
this summary manner by commitment all those who disobey
their orders to attend as witnesses, or for any purposes of their
constitutional duties. No inquiry could go forward before the
house at large or its committees, without this power to enforce
obedience; especially when the information is to be extracted
from public officers against the secret wishes of the court. It
is equally necessary (or rather more so, since evidence not being
on oath in the lower house, there can be no punishment in the
course of law) that the contumacy or prevarication of witnesses
should incur a similar penalty. No man would seek to take
away this authority from parliament, unless he is either very
ignorant of what has occurred in other times and his own, or
is a slave in the fetters of some general theory.</p>

<p>But far less can be advanced for several exertions of power
on record in the journals, which under the name of privilege
must be reckoned by impartial men irregularities and encroachments,
capable only at some periods of a kind of apology from
the unsettled state of the constitution. The Commons began,
in the famous or infamous case of Floyd, to arrogate a power
of animadverting upon political offences, which was then
wrested from them by the upper house. But in the first parliament
of Charles I. they committed Montagu (afterwards the
noted semi-popish bishop) to the serjeant, on account of a
published book, containing doctrines they did not approve.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>

For this was evidently the main point, though he was also
charged with reviling two persons who had petitioned the house,
which bore a distant resemblance to a contempt. In the long
parliament, even from its commencement, every boundary was
swept away; it was sufficient to have displeased the majority
by act or word; but no precedents can be derived from a crisis
of force struggling against force. If we descend to the reign of
William III., it will be easy to discover instances of commitments,
laudable in their purpose, but of such doubtful legality
and dangerous consequence that no regard to the motive should
induce us to justify the precedent. Graham and Burton, the
solicitors of the treasury in all the worst state prosecutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
under Charles and James, and Jenner, a baron of the exchequer,
were committed to the Tower by the council immediately after
the king's proclamation, with an intention of proceeding criminally
against them. Some months afterwards, the suspension
of the habeas corpus, which had taken place by bill, having
ceased, they moved the king's bench to admit them to bail;
but the House of Commons took this up, and, after a report of
a committee as to precedents, put them in custody of the
serjeant at arms.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
 On complaints of abuses in victualling the
navy, the commissioners of that department were sent for in
the serjeant's custody, and only released on bail ten days afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>

But, without minutely considering the questionable
instances of privilege that we may regret to find, I will select
one wherein the House of Commons appear to have gone far
beyond either the reasonable or customary limits of privilege,
and that with very little pretext of public necessity. In the
reign of George I., a newspaper called <i>Mist's Journal</i> was
notorious as the organ of the jacobite faction. A passage full
of the most impudent longings for the Pretender's restoration
having been laid before the house, it was resolved, May 28,
1721, "that the said paper is a false, malicious, scandalous,
infamous, and traitorous libel, tending to alienate the affections
of his majesty's subjects, and to excite the people to sedition
and rebellion, with an intention to subvert the present happy
establishment, and to introduce popery and arbitrary power."
They went on after this resolution to commit the printer Mist
to Newgate, and to address the king that the authors and
publishers of the libel might be prosecuted.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
 It is to be observed
that no violation of privilege either was, or indeed could be
alleged as the ground of this commitment; which seems to
imply that the house conceived itself to be invested with a
general power, at least in all political misdemeanours.</p>

<p>I have not observed any case more recent than this of Mist,
wherein any one has been committed on a charge which could
not possibly be interpreted on a contempt of the house, or a
breach of its privilege. It became however the practice, without
previously addressing the king, to direct a prosecution by
the attorney-general for offences of a public nature, which the
Commons had learned in the course of any inquiry, or which had
been formally laid before them.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
 This seems to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
introduced about the beginning of the reign of Anne, and is
undoubtedly a far more constitutional course than that of
arbitrary punishment by overstraining their privilege. In
some instances, libels have been publicly burned by the order
of one or other house of parliament.</p>

<p>I have principally adverted to the powers exerted by the
lower house of parliament, in punishing those guilty of violating
their privileges. It will of course be understood that the Lords
are at least equal in authority. In some respects indeed they
have gone beyond. I do not mean that they would be supposed
at present to have cognisance of any offence whatever, upon
which the Commons could not animadvert. Notwithstanding
what they claimed in the case of Floyd, the subsequent denial
by the Commons, and abandonment by themselves, of any
original jurisdiction, must stand in the way of their assuming
such authority over misdemeanours, more extensively at least
than the Commons, as has been shown, have in some instances
exercised it. But, while the latter have, with very few exceptions,
and none since the restoration, contented themselves with
commitment during the session, the Lords have sometimes
imposed fines, and, on some occasions in the reign of George II.,
as well as later, have adjudged parties to imprisonment for
a certain time. In one instance, so late as that reign, they
sentenced a man to the pillory; and this had been done several
times before. The judgments however of earlier ages give far
less credit to the jurisdiction than they take from it. Besides
the ever memorable case of Floyd, one John Blount, about the
same time (27th Nov. 1621), was sentenced by the Lords to
imprisonment and hard labour in Bridewell during life.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Privileges of the house not controllable by courts of law.</i>&mdash;It may
surprise those who have heard of the happy balance of the
English constitution, of the responsibility of every man to the
law, and of the security of the subject from all unlimited power,
especially as to personal freedom, that this power of awarding
punishment at discretion of the houses of parliament is generally
reputed to be universal and uncontrollable. This indeed was
by no means received at the time when the most violent usurpations
under the name of privilege were first made; the power
was questioned by the royalist party who became its victims,
and, among others, by the gallant Welshman, Judge Jenkins,
whom the long parliament had shut up in the Tower. But
it has been several times brought into discussion before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
ordinary tribunals; and the result has been, that if the power
of parliament is not unlimited in right, there is at least no
remedy provided against its excesses.</p>

<p>The House of Lords in 1677 committed to the Tower four
peers, among whom was the Earl of Shaftesbury, for a high
contempt; that is, for calling in question, during a debate, the
legal continuance of parliament after a prorogation of more
than twelve months. Shaftesbury moved the court of king's
bench to release him upon a writ of habeas corpus. But the
judges were unanimously of opinion that they had no jurisdiction
to inquire into a commitment by the Lords of one of
their body, or to discharge the party during the session, even
though there might be, as appears to have been the case, such
technical informality on the face of the commitment as would
be sufficient in an ordinary case to set it aside.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
</p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury was at this time in vehement opposition to
the court. Without insinuating that this had any effect upon
the judges, it is certain that a few years afterwards they were
less inclined to magnify the privileges of parliament. Some
who had been committed, very wantonly and oppressively, by
the Commons in 1680, under the name of abhorrers, brought
actions for false imprisonment against Topham, the serjeant-at-arms.
In one of these he put in what is called a plea to
the jurisdiction, denying the competence of the court of king's
bench, inasmuch as the alleged trespass had been done by order
of the knights, citizens, and burgesses of parliament. But the
judges overruled this plea, and ordered him to plead in bar to
the action. We do not find that Topham complied with this;
at least judgments appear to have passed against him in these
actions.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
 The Commons, after the revolution, entered on the
subject, and summoned two of the late judges, Pemberton and
Jones, to their bar. Pemberton answered that he remembered
little of the case; but if the defendant should plead that he did
arrest the plaintiff by order of the house, and should plead that
to the jurisdiction of the king's bench, he thought, with submission,
he could satisfy the house that such a plea ought to
be overruled, and that he took the law to be so very clearly.
The house pressed for his reasons, which he rather declined to
give. But on a subsequent day he fully admitted that the order
of the house was sufficient to take any one into custody, but
that it ought to be pleaded in bar, and not to the jurisdiction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
which would be of no detriment to the party, nor affect his
substantial defence. It did not appear however that he had
given any intimation from the bench of so favourable a leaning
towards the rights of parliament; and his present language
might not uncharitably be ascribed to the change of times.
The house resolved that the orders and proceedings of this
house being pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court of king's
bench, ought not to be overruled; that the judges had been
guilty of a breach of privilege, and should be taken into custody.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that, in the course of the controversy
between the two houses on the case of Ashby and White,
the Commons had sent some persons to Newgate, for suing the
returning officer of Aylesbury in defiance of their resolutions;
and that, on their application to the king's bench to be discharged
on their habeas corpus, the majority of the judges had
refused it. Three judges, Powis, Gould, and Powell, held that
the courts of Westminster Hall could have no power to judge
of the commitments of the houses of parliament; that they had
no means of knowing what were the privileges of the Commons,
and consequently could not know their boundaries; that the
law and custom of parliament stood on its own basis, and was
not to be decided by the general rules of law; that no one had
ever been discharged from such a commitment, which was an
argument that it could not be done. Holt, the chief justice,
on the other hand, maintained that no privilege of parliament
could destroy a man's right, such as that of bringing an action
for a civil injury; that neither house of parliament could
separately dispose of the liberty and property of the people,
which could only be done by the whole legislature; that the
judges were bound to take notice of the customs of parliament,
because they are part of the law of the land, and might as well
be learned as any other part of the law. "It is the law," he
said, "that gives the queen her prerogative; it is the law gives
jurisdiction to the House of Lords, as it is the law limits the
jurisdiction of the House of Commons." The eight other judges
having been consulted, though not judicially, are stated to have
gone along with the majority of the court, in holding that a
commitment by either house of parliament was not cognisable
at law. But from some of the resolutions of the Lords on this
occasion which I have quoted above, it may seem probable that,
if a writ of error had been ever heard before them, they would
have leaned to the doctrine of Holt, unless indeed withheld by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
the reflection that a similar principle might easily be extended
to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
</p>

<p>It does not appear that any commitment for breach of
privilege was disputed until the year 1751; when Mr. Alexander
Murray, of whom mention has been made, caused himself to be
brought before the court of king's bench on a habeas corpus.
But the judges were unanimous in refusing to discharge him.
"The House of Commons," said Mr. Justice Wright, "is a high
court, and it is agreed on all hands that they have power to
judge of their own privileges; it need not appear to us what the
contempt is for; if it did appear, we could not judge thereof."&mdash;"This
court," said Mr. Justice Denison, "has no jurisdiction
in the present case. We granted the habeas corpus, not knowing
what the commitment was; but now it appears to be for
a contempt of the privileges of the House of Commons. What
the privileges of either house are we do not know; nor need
they tell us what the contempt was, because we cannot judge
of it; for I must call this court inferior to the Commons with
respect to judging of their privileges, and contempts against
them." Mr. Justice Foster agreed with the two others, that
the house could commit for a contempt, which, he said, "Holt
had never denied in such a case as this before them."<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
 It would
be unnecessary to produce later cases which have occurred since
the reign of George II., and elicited still stronger expressions
from the judges of their incapacity to take cognisance of what
may be done by the Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such imposing authorities, there have not
been wanting some who have thought that the doctrine of
uncontrollable privilege is both eminently dangerous in a free
country, and repugnant to the analogy of our constitution. The
manly language of Lord Holt<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
 has seemed to rest on better principles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
of public utility, and even perhaps of positive law. It
is not however to be inferred that the right of either house
of parliament to commit persons, even not of their own body,
to prison, for contempts or breaches of privilege, ought to be
called in question. In some cases this authority is as beneficial,
and even indispensable, as it is ancient and established. Nor
do I by any means pretend that if the warrant of commitment
merely recites the party to have been guilty of a contempt or
breach of privilege, the truth of such allegation could be
examined upon a return to a writ of habeas corpus, any more
than in an ordinary case of felony. Whatever injustice may thus
be done cannot have redress by any legal means; because the
House of Commons (or the Lords, as it may be) are the fit judges
of the fact, and must be presumed to have determined it according
to right.</p>

<p>But it is a more doubtful question, whether, if they should
pronounce an offence to be a breach of privilege, as in the
case of the Aylesbury men, which a court of justice should
perceive to be clearly none, or if they should commit a man on
a charge of misdemeanour, and for no breach of privilege at all,
as in the case of Mist the printer, such excesses of jurisdiction
might not legally be restrained by the judges. If the resolutions
of the Lords in the business of Ashby and White are constitutional
and true, neither house of parliament can create to itself
any new privilege; a proposition surely so consonant to the
rules of English law, which require prescription or statute as
the basis for every right, that few will dispute it; and it must
be still less lawful to exercise a jurisdiction over misdemeanours,
by committing a party who would regularly be only held to
bail on such a charge. Of this I am very certain, that if Mist,
in the year 1721, had applied for his discharge on a habeas
corpus, it would have been far more difficult to have opposed
it on the score of precedent or of constitutional right, than it
was for the attorney-general of Charles I., nearly one hundred
years before, to resist the famous arguments of Selden and
Littleton, in the case of the Buckinghamshire gentlemen committed
by the council. If a few scattered acts of power can
make such precedents as a court of justice must take as its rule,
I am sure the decision, neither in this case nor in that of ship-money,
was so unconstitutional as we usually suppose: it was
by dwelling on all authorities in favour of liberty, and by
setting aside those which made against it, that our ancestors
overthrew the claims of unbounded prerogative. Nor is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
parallel less striking when we look at the tone of implicit obedience,
respect, and confidence with which the judges of the
eighteenth century have spoken of the houses of parliament, as
if their sphere were too low for the cognisance of such a transcendant
authority.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
 The same language, almost to the words,
was heard from the lips of the Hydes and Berkeleys in the
preceding age, in reference to the king and to the privy council.
But as, when the spirit of the government was almost wholly
monarchical, so since it has turned chiefly to an aristocracy,
the courts of justice have been swayed towards the predominant
influence, not, in general, by any undue motives, but because
it is natural for them to support power, to shun offence, and to
shelter themselves behind precedent. They have also sometimes
had in view the analogy of parliamentary commitments
to their own power of attachment for contempt, which they
hold to be equally uncontrollable; a doctrine by no means so
dangerous to the subject's liberty, but liable also to no trifling
objections.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
</p>

<p>The consequences of this utter irresponsibility in each of the
two houses will appear still more serious, when we advert to the
unlimited power of punishment which it draws with it. The
Commons indeed do not pretend to imprison beyond the session;
but the Lords have imposed fines and definite imprisonment;
and attempts to resist these have been unsuccessful.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
 If the
matter is to rest upon precedent, or upon what overrides precedent
itself, the absolute failure of jurisdiction in the ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
courts, there seems nothing (decency and discretion excepted)
to prevent their repeating the sentences of James I.'s reign,
whipping, branding, hard labour for life. Nay, they might order
the usher of the black rod to take a man from their bar, and
hang him up in the lobby. Such things would not be done, and,
being done, would not be endured; but it is much that any sworn
ministers of the law should, even by indefinite language, have
countenanced the legal possibility of tyrannous power in
England. The temper of government itself, in modern times,
has generally been mild; and this is probably the best ground
of confidence in the discretion of parliament; but popular, that
is, numerous bodies, are always prone to excess, both from the
reciprocal influences of their passions, and the consciousness of
irresponsibility; for which reasons a democracy, that is, the
absolute government of the majority, is in general the most
tyrannical of any. Public opinion, it is true, in this country,
imposes a considerable restraint; yet this check is somewhat
less powerful in that branch of the legislature which has gone
the farthest in chastising breaches of privilege. I would not be
understood, however, to point at any more recent discussions on
this subject; were it not, indeed, beyond the limits prescribed
to me, it might be shown that the House of Commons, in asserting
its jurisdiction, has receded from much of the arbitrary
power which it once arrogated, and which some have been
disposed to bestow upon it.</p>

<p>IV. It is commonly and justly said that civil liberty is not
only consistent with, but in its terms implies, the restrictive
limitations of natural liberty which are imposed by law. But,
as these are not the less real limitations of liberty, it can hardly
be maintained that the subject's condition is not impaired by
very numerous restraints upon his will, even without reference
to their expediency. The price may be well paid; but it is still
a price that it costs some sacrifice to pay. Our statutes have
been growing in bulk and multiplicity with the regular session
of parliament, and with the new system of government; all
abounding with prohibitions and penalties, which every man is
presumed to know, but which no man, the judges themselves
included, can really know with much exactness. We literally
walk amidst the snares and pitfalls of the law. The very
doctrine of the more rigid casuists, that men are bound in conscience
to observe all the laws of their country, has become
impracticable through their complexity and inconvenience; and
most of us are content to shift off their penalties in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
prohibita</span></i> with as little scruple as some feel in risking those
of graver offences. But what more peculiarly belongs to the
present subject is the systematic encroachment upon ancient
constitutional principles, which has for a long time been made
through new enactments, proceeding from the Crown, chiefly in
respect to the revenue.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
 These may be traced indeed in the
statute-book, at least as high as the restoration, and really
began in the arbitrary times of revolution which preceded it.
They have, however, been gradually extended along with the
public burthens, and as the severity of these has prompted fresh
artifices of evasion. It would be curious, but not within the
scope of this work, to analyse our immense fiscal law, and to
trace the history of its innovations. These consist, partly in
taking away the cognisance of offences against the revenue from
juries, whose partiality in such cases there was in truth much
reason to apprehend, and vesting it either in commissioners of
the revenue itself or in magistrates; partly in anomalous and
somewhat arbitrary power with regard to the collection; partly
in deviations from the established rules of pleading and evidence,
by throwing on the accused party in fiscal causes the burthen
of proving his innocence, or by superseding the necessity of
rigorous proof as to matters wherein it is ordinarily required;
and partly in shielding the officers of the Crown, as far as
possible, from their responsibility for illegal actions, by permitting
special circumstances of justification to be given in
evidence without being pleaded, or by throwing impediments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
various kinds in the way of the prosecutor, or by subjecting him
to unusual costs in the event of defeat.</p>

<p><i>Extension of penal laws.</i>&mdash;These restraints upon personal
liberty, and what is worse, these endeavours, as they seem, to
prevent the fair administration of justice between the Crown
and the subject, have in general, more especially in modern
times, excited little regard as they have passed through the
houses of parliament. A sad necessity has over-ruled the
maxims of ancient law; nor is it my business to censure our
fiscal code, but to point out that it is to be counted as a set-off
against the advantages of the revolution, and has in fact
diminished the freedom and justice which we claim for our
polity. And, that its provisions have sometimes gone so far
as to give alarm to not very susceptible minds, may be shown
from a remarkable debate in the year 1737. A bill having been
brought in by the ministers to prevent smuggling, which contained
some unusual clauses, it was strongly opposed, among
other peers, by Lord Chancellor Talbot himself, of course, in the
cabinet, and by Lord Hardwicke, then chief justice, a regularly
bred Crown lawyer, and in his whole life disposed to hold very
high the authority of government. They objected to a clause
subjecting any three persons travelling with arms, to the penalty
of transportation, on proof by two witnesses that their intention
was to assist in the clandestine landing, or carrying away prohibited
or uncustomed goods. "We have in our laws," said one
of the opposing lords, "no such thing as a crime by implication,
nor can a malicious intention ever be proved by witnesses.
Facts only are admitted to be proved, and from those facts the
judge and jury are to determine with what intention they were
committed; but no judge or jury can ever, by our laws, suppose,
much less determine, that an action, in itself innocent or indifferent,
was attended with a criminal and malicious intention.
Another security for our liberties is, that no subject can be
imprisoned unless some felonious and high crime be sworn
against him. This, with respect to private men, is the very
foundation stone of all our liberties; and, if we remove it, if we
but knock off a corner, we may probably overturn the whole
fabric. A third guard for our liberties is that right which every
subject has, not only to provide himself with arms proper for his
defence, but to accustom himself to the use of those arms, and to
travel with them whenever he has a mind." But the clause in
question, it was contended, was repugnant to all the maxims of
free government. No presumption of a crime could be drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
from the mere wearing of arms, an act not only innocent, but
highly commendable; and therefore the admitting of witnesses
to prove that any of these men were armed, in order to assist in
smuggling, would be the admitting of witnesses to prove an
intention, which was inconsistent with the whole tenor of our
laws.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
 They objected to another provision, subjecting a party
against whom information should be given that he intended to
assist in smuggling, to imprisonment without bail, though the
offence itself were in its nature bailable; to another, which
made informations for assault upon officers of the revenue
triable in any county of England; and to a yet more startling
protection thrown round the same favoured class, that the
magistrates should be bound to admit them to bail on charges
of killing or wounding any one in the execution of their duty.
The bill itself was carried by no great majority; and the
provisions subsist at this day, or perhaps have received a
further extension.</p>

<p>It will thus appear to every man who takes a comprehensive
view of our constitutional history, that the executive government,
though shorn of its lustre, has not lost so much of its real efficacy
by the consequences of the revolution as is often supposed; at
least, that with a regular army to put down insurrection, and
an influence sufficient to obtain fresh statutes of restriction, if
such should ever be deemed necessary, it is not exposed, in the
ordinary course of affairs, to any serious hazard. But we must
here distinguish the executive government, using that word in
its largest sense, from the Crown itself, or the personal authority
of the sovereign. This is a matter of rather delicate inquiry,
but too material to be passed by.</p>

<p><i>Diminution of personal authority of the Crown.</i>&mdash;The real power
of the prince, in the most despotic monarchy, must have its limits
from nature, and bear some proportion to his courage, his
activity, and his intellect. The tyrants of the East become
puppets or slaves of their vizirs; or it turns to a game of cunning,
wherein the winner is he who shall succeed in tying the
bow-string round the other's neck. After some ages of feeble
monarchs, the titular royalty is found wholly separated from
the power of command, and glides on to posterity in its languid
channel, till some usurper or conqueror stops up the stream for
ever. In the civilised kingdoms of Europe, those very institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
which secure the permanence of royal families, and afford
them a guarantee against manifest subjection to a minister, take
generally out of the hands of the sovereign the practical government
of his people. Unless his capacities are above the level
of ordinary kings, he must repose on the wisdom and diligence
of the statesmen he employs, with the sacrifice, perhaps, of his
own prepossessions in policy, and against the bent of his personal
affections. The power of a king of England is not to be compared
with an ideal absoluteness, but with that which could be
enjoyed in the actual state of society by the same person in a
less bounded monarchy.</p>

<p>The descendants of William the Conqueror on the English
throne, down to the end of the seventeenth century, have been
a good deal above the average in those qualities which enable
or at least induce, kings to take on themselves a large share of
the public administration; as will appear by comparing their
line with that of the house of Capet, or perhaps most others
during an equal period. Without going farther back, we know
that Henry VII., Henry VIII., Elizabeth, the four kings of the
house of Stuart, though not always with as much ability as
diligence, were the master-movers of their own policy, not very
susceptible of advice, and always sufficiently acquainted with
the details of government to act without it. This was eminently
the case also with William III., who was truly his own minister,
and much better fitted for that office than those who served
him. The king, according to our constitution, is supposed to be
present in council, and was in fact usually, or very frequently,
present, so long as the council remained as a deliberative body
for matters of domestic and foreign policy. But, when a junto
or cabinet came to supersede that ancient and responsible
body, the king himself ceased to preside, and received their
advice separately, according to their respective functions of
treasurer, secretary, or chancellor, or that of the whole
cabinet through one of its leading members. This change
however was gradual; for cabinet councils were sometimes
held in the presence of William and Anne; to which other
counsellors, not strictly of that select number, were occasionally
summoned.</p>

<p>But on the accession of the house of Hanover, this personal
superintendence of the sovereign necessarily came to an end.
The fact is hardly credible that, George I. being incapable of
speaking English, as Sir Robert Walpole was of conversing in
French, the monarch and his minister held discourse with each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
other in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
 It is impossible that, with so defective a means
of communication (for Walpole, though by no means an illiterate
man, cannot be supposed to have spoken readily a language very
little familiar in this country), George could have obtained much
insight into his domestic affairs, or been much acquainted with
the characters of his subjects. We know, in truth, that he
nearly abandoned the consideration of both, and trusted his
ministers with the entire management of this kingdom, content
to employ its great name for the promotion of his electoral
interests. This continued in a less degree to be the case with
his son, who, though better acquainted with the language and
circumstances of Great Britain, and more jealous of his prerogative,
was conscious of his incapacity to determine on matters
of domestic government, and reserved almost his whole attention
for the politics of Germany.</p>

<p><i>Party connections.</i>&mdash;The broad distinctions of party contributed
to weaken the real supremacy of the sovereign. It had
been usual before the revolution, and in the two succeeding
reigns, to select ministers individually at discretion; and,
though some might hold themselves at liberty to decline office,
it was by no means deemed a point of honour and fidelity to
do so. Hence men in the possession of high posts had no strong
bond of union, and frequently took opposite sides on public
measures of no light moment. The queen particularly was
always loth to discard a servant on account of his vote in parliament;
a conduct generous perhaps, but feeble, inconvenient,
when carried to such excess, in our constitution, and in effect
holding out a reward to ingratitude and treachery. But the
whigs having come exclusively into office under the line of
Hanover (which, as I have elsewhere observed, was inevitable),
formed a sort of phalanx, which the Crown was not always able
to break, and which never could have been broken, but for that
internal force of repulsion by which personal cupidity and
ambition are ever tending to separate the elements of factions.
It became the point of honour among public men to fight uniformly
under the same banner, though not perhaps for the same
cause; if indeed there was any cause really fought for, but the
advancement of a party. In this preference of certain denominations,
or of certain leaders, to the real principles which ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
to be the basis of political consistency, there was an evident
deviation from the true standard of public virtue; but the
ignominy attached to the dereliction of friends for the sake of
emolument, though it was every day incurred, must have tended
gradually to purify the general character of parliament. Meanwhile
the Crown lost all that party attachments gained; a truth
indisputable on reflection, though while the Crown and the party
in power act in the same direction, the relative efficiency of the
two forces is not immediately estimated. It was seen, however,
very manifestly in the year 1746; when, after long bickering
between the Pelhams and Lord Granville, the king's favourite
minister, the former, in conjunction with a majority of the
cabinet, threw up their offices, and compelled the king, after
an abortive effort at a new administration, to sacrifice his
favourite, and replace those in power whom he could not exclude
from it. The same took place in a later period of his reign,
when after many struggles he submitted to the ascendency of
Mr. Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>It seems difficult for any king of England, however conscientiously
observant of the lawful rights of his subjects, and
of the limitations they impose on his prerogative, to rest always
very content with this practical condition of the monarchy.
The choice of his counsellors, the conduct of government, are
intrusted, he will be told, by the constitution to his sole pleasure.
Yet both in the one and the other he finds a perpetual disposition
to restrain his exercise of power; and, though it is easy to
demonstrate that the public good is far better promoted by the
virtual control of parliament and the nation over the whole
executive government, than by adhering to the letter of the
constitution, it is not to be expected that the argument will
be conclusive to a royal understanding. Hence, he may be
tempted to play rather a petty game, and endeavour to regain,
by intrigue and insincerity, that power of acting by his own
will, which he thinks unfairly wrested from him. A king of
England, in the calculations of politics, is little more than one
among the public men of the day; taller indeed, like Saul or
Agamemnon, by the head and shoulders, and therefore with no
slight advantages in the scramble; but not a match for the
many, unless he can bring some dexterity to second his strength,
and make the best of the self-interest and animosities of those
with whom he has to deal. And of this there will generally be
so much, that in the long run he will be found to succeed in
the greater part of his desires. Thus George I. and George II.,
in whom the personal authority seems to have been at the
lowest point it has ever reached, drew their ministers, not always
willingly, into that course of continental politics which was
supposed to serve the purposes of Hanover far better than of
England. It is well known that the Walpoles and the Pelhams
condemned in private this excessive predilection of their masters
for their native country, which alone could endanger their
English throne.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
 Yet after the two latter brothers had inveighed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
against Lord Granville, and driven him out of power
for seconding the king's pertinacity in continuing the war of
1743, they went on themselves in the same track for at least
two years, to the imminent hazard of losing for ever the Low
Countries and Holland, if the French government, so indiscriminately
charged with ambition, had not displayed extraordinary
moderation at the treaty of Aix la Chapelle. The
twelve years that ensued gave more abundant proofs of the
submissiveness with which the schemes of George II. for the
good of Hanover were received by his ministers, though not by
his people; but the most striking instance of all is the abandonment
by Mr. Pitt himself of all his former professions in pouring
troops into Germany. I do not inquire whether a sense of
national honour might not render some of these measures justifiable,
though none of them were advantageous; but it is certain
that the strong bent of the king's partiality forced them on
against the repugnance of most statesmen, as well as of the
great majority in parliament and out of it.</p>

<p>Comparatively however with the state of prerogative before
the revolution, we can hardly dispute that there has been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
systematic diminution of the reigning prince's control, which,
though it may be compensated or concealed in ordinary times
by the general influence of the executive administration, is of
material importance in a constitutional light. Independently
of other consequences which might be pointed out as probable
or contingent, it affords a real security against endeavours by
the Crown to subvert or essentially impair the other parts of
our government. For, though a king may believe himself and
his posterity to be interested in obtaining arbitrary power, it is
far less likely that a minister should desire to do so&mdash;I mean
arbitrary, not in relation to temporary or partial abridgments
of the subject's liberty, but to such projects as Charles I. and
James II. attempted to execute. What indeed might be effected
by a king, at once able, active, popular, and ambitious, should
such ever unfortunately appear in this country, it is not easy
to predict; certainly his reign would be dangerous, on one side
or other, to the present balance of the constitution. But
against this contingent evil, or the far more probable encroachments
of ministers, which, though not going the full length
of despotic power, might slowly undermine and contract the
rights of the people, no positive statutes can be devised so
effectual as the vigilance of the people themselves and their
increased means of knowing and estimating the measures of
their government.</p>

<p><i>Influence of political writings.</i>&mdash;The publication of regular
newspapers, partly designed for the communication of intelligence,
partly for the discussion of political topics, may be
referred, upon the whole, to the reign of Anne, when they
obtained great circulation, and became the accredited organs
of different factions. The tory ministers, towards the close of
that reign, were annoyed at the vivacity of the press both in
periodical and other writings, which led to a stamp-duty,
intended chiefly to diminish their number, and was nearly
producing more pernicious restrictions, such as renewing the
licensing act, or compelling authors to acknowledge their names.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>

These however did not take place, and the government more
honourably coped with their adversaries in the same warfare;
nor, with Swift and Bolingbroke on their side, could they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
require, except indeed through the badness of their cause, any
aid from the arm of power.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
</p>

<p>In a single hour these two great masters of language were
changed from advocates of the Crown to tribunes of the people;
both more distinguished as writers in this altered scene of their
fortunes, and certainly among the first political combatants
with the weapons of the press whom the world has ever known.
Bolingbroke's influence was of course greater in England; and,
with all the signal faults of his public character, with all the
factiousness which dictated most of his writings and the indefinite
declamation or shallow reasoning which they frequently
display, they have merits not always sufficiently acknowledged.
He seems first to have made the tories reject their old tenets
of exalted prerogative and hereditary right, and scorn the high-church
theories which they had maintained under William and
Anne. His <i>Dissertation on Parties</i>, and <i>Letters on the History
of England</i>, are in fact written on whig principles (if I know
what is meant by that name) in their general tendency; however
a politician, who had always some particular end in view,
may have fallen into several inconsistencies. The same character
is due to the <i>Craftsman</i>, and to most of the temporary
pamphlets directed against Sir Robert Walpole. They teemed,
it is true, with exaggerated declamations on the side of liberty;
but that was the side they took; it was to generous prejudices
they appealed, nor did they ever advert to the times before the
revolution but with contempt or abhorrence. Libels there were
indeed of a different class, proceeding from the jacobite school;
but these obtained little regard; the jacobites themselves, or
such as affected to be so, having more frequently espoused that
cause from a sense of dissatisfaction with the conduct of the
reigning family than from much regard to the pretensions of the
other. Upon the whole matter it must be evident to every
person who is at all conversant with the publications of George
II.'s reign, with the poems, the novels, the essays, and almost
all the literature of the time, that what are called the popular
or liberal doctrines of government were decidedly prevalent.
The supporters themselves of the Walpole and Pelham administrations,
though professedly whigs, and tenacious of revolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
principles, made complaints, both in parliament and in pamphlets,
of the democratical spirit, the insubordination to authority,
the tendency to republican sentiments, which they alleged to
have gained ground among the people. It is certain that
the tone of popular opinion gave some countenance to these
assertions, though much exaggerated to create alarm in the
aristocratical classes, and furnish arguments against redress of
abuses.</p>

<p><i>Publication of debates.</i>&mdash;The two houses of parliament are
supposed to deliberate with closed doors. It is always competent
for any one member to insist that strangers be excluded;
not on any special ground, but by merely enforcing the standing
order for that purpose. It has been several times resolved, that
it is a high breach of privilege to publish any speeches or proceedings
of the Commons; though they have since directed
their own votes and resolutions to be printed. Many persons
have been punished by commitment for this offence; and it is
still highly irregular, in any debate, to allude to the reports in
newspapers, except for the purpose of animadverting on the
breach of privilege.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
 Notwithstanding this pretended strictness,
notices of the more interesting discussions were frequently
made public; and entire speeches were sometimes circulated by
those who had sought popularity in delivering them. After
the accession of George I. we find a pretty regular account of
debates in an annual publication, Boyer's <i>Historical Register</i>,
which was continued to the year 1737. They were afterwards
published monthly, and much more at length, in the <i>London</i>
and the <i>Gentleman's Magazines</i>; the latter, as is well known,
improved by the pen of Johnson yet not so as to lose by any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
means the leading scope of the arguments. It follows of course
that the restriction upon the presence of strangers had been
almost entirely dispensed with. A transparent veil was thrown
over this innovation by disguising the names of the speakers,
or more commonly by printing only initial and final letters.
This ridiculous affectation of concealment was extended to
many other words in political writings, and had not wholly
ceased in the American war.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to over-rate the value of this regular
publication of proceedings in parliament, carried as it has been
in our own time to nearly as great copiousness and accuracy
as is probably attainable. It tends manifestly and powerfully
to keep within bounds the supineness and negligence, the
partiality and corruption, to which every parliament, either
from the nature of its composition or the frailty of mankind,
must more or less be liable. Perhaps the constitution would
not have stood so long, or rather would have stood like an useless
and untenanted mansion, if this unlawful means had not kept
up a perpetual intercourse, a reciprocity of influence between
the parliament and the people. A stream of fresh air, boisterous
perhaps sometimes as the winds of the north, yet as healthy and
invigorating, flows in to renovate the stagnant atmosphere, and
to prevent that <i>malaria</i>, which self-interest and oligarchical
exclusiveness are always tending to generate. Nor has its
importance been less perceptible in affording the means of
vindicating the measures of government, and securing to them,
when just and reasonable, the approbation of the majority
among the middle ranks, whose weight in the scale has been
gradually increasing during the last and present centuries.</p>

<p><i>Increased influence of the middle ranks.</i>&mdash;This augmentation
of the democratical influence, using that term as applied to the
commercial and industrious classes in contradistinction to the
territorial aristocracy, was the slow but certain effect of accumulated
wealth and diffused knowledge, acting however on the
traditional notions of freedom and equality which had ever
prevailed in the English people. The nation, exhausted by
the long wars of William and Anne, recovered strength in thirty
years of peace that ensued; and in that period, especially under
the prudent rule of Walpole, the seeds of our commercial greatness
were gradually ripened. It was evidently the most prosperous
season that England had ever experienced; and the
progression, though slow, being uniform, the reign perhaps of
George II. might not disadvantageously be compared, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
real happiness of the community, with that more brilliant but
uncertain and oscillatory condition which has ensued. A distinguished
writer has observed that the labourer's wages have
never, at least for many ages, commanded so large a portion of
subsistence as in this part of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
 The
public debt, though it excited alarms from its magnitude, at
which we are now accustomed to smile, and though too little
care was taken for redeeming it, did not press very heavily on
the nation; as the low rate of interest evinces, the government
securities at three per cent. having generally stood above par.
In the war of 1743, which from the selfish practice of relying
wholly on loans did not much retard the immediate advance of
the country, and still more after the peace of Aix la Chapelle,
a striking increase of wealth became perceptible.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
 This was
shown in one circumstance directly affecting the character of
the constitution. The smaller boroughs, which had been from
the earliest time under the command of neighbouring peers and
gentlemen, or sometimes of the Crown, were attempted by rich
capitalists, with no other connection or recommendation than
one which is generally sufficient. This appears to have been
first observed in the general election of 1747 and 1754;<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
 and
though the prevalence of bribery is attested by the statute-book,
and the journals of parliament from the revolution, it
seems not to have broken down all floodgates till near the end
of the reign of George II. The sale of seats in parliament, like
any other transferable property, is never mentioned in any book
that I remember to have seen of an earlier date than 1760. We
may dispense therefore with the enquiry in what manner this
extraordinary traffic has affected the constitution, observing
only that its influence must have tended to counteract that of
the territorial aristocracy, which is still sufficiently predominant.
The country gentlemen, who claimed to themselves a character
of more independence and patriotism than could be found in
any other class, had long endeavoured to protect their ascendancy
by excluding the rest of the community from parliament.
This was the principle of the bill, which, after being frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
attempted, passed into a law during the tory administration of
Anne, requiring every member of the Commons, except those
for the universities, to possess, as a qualification for his seat, a
landed estate, above all incumbrances, of £300 a year.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
 By a
later act of George II., with which it was thought expedient,
by the government of the day, to gratify the landed interest,
this property must be stated on oath by every member on
taking his seat, and, if required, at his election.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
 The law is
however notoriously evaded; and though much might be urged
in favour of rendering a competent income the condition of
eligibility, few would be found at present to maintain that the
freehold qualification is not required both unconstitutionally,
according to the ancient theory of representation, and absurdly,
according to the present state of property in England. But I
am again admonished, as I have frequently been in writing these
last pages, to break off from subjects that might carry me too
far away from the business of this history; and, content with
compiling and selecting the records of the past, to shun the
difficult and ambitious office of judging the present, or of
speculating upon the future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="s08">ON THE CONSTITUTION OF SCOTLAND&mdash;INTRODUCTION OF
THE FEUDAL SYSTEM</span></h2>

<p>It is not very profitable to enquire into the constitutional
antiquities of a country which furnishes no authentic historian,
nor laws, nor charters, to guide our research, as is the case with
Scotland before the twelfth century. The latest and most
laborious of her antiquaries appears to have proved that her
institutions were wholly Celtic until that era, and greatly similar
to those of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
 A total, though probably gradual, change
must therefore have taken place in the next age, brought about
by means which have not been satisfactorily explained. The
Crown became strictly hereditary, the governors of districts
took the appellation of earls, the whole kingdom was subjected
to a feudal tenure, the Anglo-Norman laws, tribunals, local and
municipal magistracies were introduced as far as the royal
influence could prevail; above all, a surprising number of
families, chiefly Norman, but some of Saxon or Flemish descent,
settled upon estates granted by the kings of Scotland, and
became the founders of its aristocracy. It was, as truly as some
time afterwards in Ireland, the encroachment of a Gothic and
feudal polity upon the inferior civilisation of the Celts, though
accomplished with far less resistance, and not quite so slowly.
Yet the Highland tribes long adhered to their ancient usages;
nor did the laws of English origin obtain in some other districts
two or three centuries after their establishment on both sides
of the Forth.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Scots parliament.</i>&mdash;It became almost a necessary consequence
from this adoption of the feudal system, and assimilation to the
English institutions, that the kings of Scotland would have
their general council or parliament upon nearly the same model
as that of the Anglo-Norman sovereigns they so studiously
imitated. If the statutes ascribed to William the Lion, contemporary
with our Henry II., are genuine, they were enacted,
as we should expect to find, with the concurrence of the bishops,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
abbots, barons, and other good men (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">probi homines</span>) of the
land; meaning doubtless the inferior tenants in capite.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
 These
laws indeed are questionable, and there is a great want of
unequivocal records till almost the end of the thirteenth century.
The representatives of boroughs are first distinctly mentioned
in 1326, under Robert I.; though some have been of opinion
that vestiges of their appearance in parliament may be traced
higher; but they are not enumerated among the classes present
in one held in 1315.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
 In the ensuing reign of David II., the
three estates of the realm are expressly mentioned as the legislative
advisers of the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
</p>

<p>A Scots parliament resembled an English one in the mode of
convocation, in the ranks that composed it, in the enacting
powers of the king, and the necessary consent of the three
estates; but differed in several very important respects. No
freeholders, except tenants in capite, had ever any right of
suffrage; which may, not improbably, have been in some
measure owing to the want of that Anglo-Saxon institution,
the county court. These feudal tenants of the Crown came in
person to parliament, as they did in England till the reign of
Henry III., and sat together with the prelates and barons in
one chamber. A prince arose in Scotland in the first part of
the fifteenth century, resembling the English Justinian in his
politic regard to strengthening his own prerogative and to
maintaining public order. It was enacted by a law of James I.,
in 1427, that the smaller barons and free tenants "need not to
come to parliament, so that of every sheriffdom there be sent
two or more wise men, chosen at the head court," to represent
the rest. These were to elect a speaker, through whom they
were to communicate with the king and other estates.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
 This
was evidently designed as an assimilation to the English House
of Commons. But the statute not being imperative, no regard
was paid to this permission; and it is not till 1587 that we find
the representation of the Scots counties finally established by
law; though one important object of James's policy was never
attained, the different estates of parliament having always voted
promiscuously, as the spiritual and temporal lords in England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p><i>Power of the aristocracy.</i>&mdash;But no distinction between the
national councils of the two kingdoms was more essential than
what appears to have been introduced into the Scots parliament
under David II. In the year 1367 a parliament having met at
Scone, a committee was chosen by the three estates, who seem
to have had full powers delegated to them, the others returning
home on account of the advanced season. The same was done
in one held next year, without any assigned pretext. But in
1369 this committee was chosen only to prepare all matters
determinable in parliament, or fit to be therein treated for the
decision of the three estates on the last day but one of the
session.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
 The former scheme appeared possibly, even to those
careless and unwilling legislators, too complete an abandonment
of their function. But even modified as it was in 1369, it tended
to devolve the whole business of parliament on this elective
committee, subsequently known by the appellation of lords of
the articles. It came at last to be the general practice, though
some exceptions to this rule may be found, that nothing was
laid before parliament without their previous recommendation;
and there seems reason to think that in the first parliament of
James I., in 1424, such full powers were delegated to the committee
as had been granted before in 1367 and 1368, and that
the three estates never met again to sanction their resolutions.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>

The preparatory committee is not uniformly mentioned in the
preamble of statutes made during the reign of this prince and
his two next successors; but there may be no reason to infer
from thence that it was not appointed. From the reign of
James IV. the lords of articles are regularly named in the
records of every parliament.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
</p>

<p>It is said that a Scots parliament, about the middle of the
fifteenth century, consisted of near one hundred and ninety
persons.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
 We do not find however that more than half this
number usually attended. A list of those present in 1472 gives
but fourteen bishops and abbots, twenty-two earls and barons,
thirty-four lairds or lesser tenants in capite, and eight deputies
of boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
 The royal boroughs entitled to be represented
in parliament were above thirty; but it was a common usage
to choose the deputies of other towns as their proxies.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
 The
great object with them, as well as with the lesser barons, was
to save the cost and trouble of attendance. It appears indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
that they formed rather an insignificant portion of the legislative
body. They are not named as consenting parties in several of
the statutes of James III.; and it seems that on some occasions
they had not been summoned to parliament, for an act was
passed in 1504, "that the commissaries and headsmen of the
burghs be warned when taxes or constitutions are given, to
have their advice therein, as one of the three estates of the
realm."<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
 This however is an express recognition of their
right, though it might have been set aside by an irregular
exercise of power.</p>

<p><i>Royal influence in parliament.</i>&mdash;It was a natural result from
the constitution of a Scots parliament, together with the general
state of society in that kingdom, that its efforts were almost
uniformly directed to augment and invigorate the royal authority.
Their statutes afford a remarkable contrast to those of England
in the absence of provisions against the exorbitances of prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>

Robertson has observed that the kings of Scotland,
from the time at least of James I., acted upon a steady system
of repressing the aristocracy; and though this has been called
too refined a supposition, and attempts have been made to
explain otherwise their conduct, it seems strange to deny the
operation of a motive so natural, and so readily to be inferred
from their measures. The causes so well pointed out by this
historian, and some that might be added; the defensible nature
of great part of the country; the extensive possessions of some
powerful families; the influence of feudal tenure and Celtic
clanship; the hereditary jurisdiction, hardly controlled, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
in theory, by the supreme tribunals of the Crown; the custom
of entering into bonds of association for mutual defence; the
frequent minorities of the reigning princes; the necessary
abandonment of any strict regard to monarchical supremacy,
during the struggle for independence against England; the
election of one great nobleman to the Crown and its devolution
upon another; the residence of the two first of the Stuart name
in their own remote domains; the want of any such effective
counterpoise to the aristocracy as the sovereigns of England
possessed in its yeomanry and commercial towns, placed the
kings of Scotland in a situation which neither for their own nor
their people's interest they could be expected to endure. But
an impatience of submitting to the insolent and encroaching
temper of their nobles drove James I. (before whose time no
settled scheme of reviving the royal authority seems to have
been conceived), and his two next descendants into some courses
which, though excused or extenuated by the difficulties of their
position, were rather too precipitate and violent, and redounded
at least to their own destruction. The reign of James IV., from
his accession in 1488 to his unhappy death at Flodden in 1513,
was the first of tolerable prosperity; the Crown having by this
time obtained no inconsiderable strength, and the course of
law being somewhat more established, though the aristocracy
were abundantly capable of withstanding any material encroachment
upon their privileges.</p>

<p>Though subsidies were, of course, occasionally demanded,
yet from the poverty of the realm, and the extensive domains
which the Crown retained, they were much less frequent than
in England, and thus one principal source of difference was
removed; nor do we read of any opposition in parliament to
what the Lords of articles thought fit to propound. Those who
disliked the government stood aloof from such meetings, where
the sovereign was in his vigour, and had sometimes crushed a
leader of faction by a sudden stroke of power; confident that
they could better frustrate the execution of laws than their enactment,
and that questions of right and privilege could never
be tried so advantageously as in the field. Hence it is, as I have
already observed, that we must not look to the statute-book of
Scotland for many limitations of monarchy. Even in one of
James II., which enacts that none of the royal domains shall for
the future be alienated, and that the king and his successors shall
be sworn to observe this law, it may be conjectured that a provision
rather derogatory in semblance to the king's dignity was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
introduced by his own suggestion, as an additional security
against the importunate solicitations of the aristocracy whom
the statute was designed to restrain.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
 The next reign was the
struggle of an imprudent, and, as far as his means extended,
despotic prince, against the spirit of his subjects. In a parliament
of 1487, we find almost a solitary instance of a statute that
appears to have been directed against some illegal proceedings
of the government. It is provided that all civil suits shall be
determined by the ordinary judges, and not before the king's
council.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
 James III. was killed the next year in attempting to
oppose an extensive combination of the rebellious nobility. In
the reign of James IV., the influence of the aristocracy shows
itself rather more in legislation; and two peculiarities deserve
notice, in which, as it is said, the legislative authority of a Scots
parliament was far higher than that of our own. They were not
only often consulted about peace or war, which in some instances
was the case in England, but, at least in the sixteenth century,
their approbation seems to have been necessary.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
 This, though
not consonant to our modern notions, was certainly no more
than the genius of the feudal system and the character of a great
deliberative council might lead us to expect; but a more remarkable
singularity was, that what had been propounded by
the lords of articles, and received the ratification of the three
estates, did not require the king's consent to give it complete
validity. Such at least is said to have been the Scots constitution
in the time of James VI.; though we may demand very full
proof of such an anomaly, which the language of their statutes,
expressive of the king's enacting power, by no means leads us
to infer.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Judicial power.</i>&mdash;The kings of Scotland had always their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aula</span>
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">curia regis</span>, claiming a supreme judicial authority, at least
in some causes, though it might be difficult to determine its
boundaries, or how far they were respected. They had also
bailiffs to administer justice in their own domains, and sheriffs in
every county for the same purpose, wherever grants of regality
did not exclude their jurisdiction. These regalities were hereditary
and territorial; they extended to the infliction of capital
punishment; the lord possessing them might reclaim or re-pledge
(as it was called, from the surety he was obliged to give
that he would himself do justice) any one of his vassals who
was accused before another jurisdiction. The barons, who also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
had cognisance of most capital offences, and the royal boroughs,
enjoyed the same privilege. An appeal lay, in civil suits, from
the baron's court to that of the sheriff or lord of regality, and
ultimately to the parliament, or to a certain number of persons
to whom it delegated its authority.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Court of Session.</i>&mdash;This appellant jurisdiction of parliament,
as well as that of the king's privy council, which was original,
came, by a series of provisions from the year 1425 to 1532, into
the hands of a supreme tribunal thus gradually constituted in
its present form, the court of session. It was composed of
fifteen judges, half of whom, besides the president, were at first
churchmen, and soon established an entire subordination of the
local courts in all civil suits. But it possessed no competence
in criminal proceedings; the hereditary jurisdictions remained
unaffected for some ages, though the king's two justiciaries,
replaced afterwards by a court of six judges, went their circuits
even through those counties wherein charters of regality had
been granted. Two remarkable innovations seem to have
accompanied, or to have been not far removed in time from, the
first formation of the court of session; the discontinuance of
juries in civil causes, and the adoption of so many principles
from the Roman law as have given the jurisprudence of Scotland
a very different character from our own.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
</p>

<p>In the reign of James V. it might appear probable that by the
influence of laws favourable to public order, better enforced
through the council and court of session than before, by the final
subjugation of the house of Douglas and of the Earls of Ross in
the North, and some slight increase of wealth in the towns,
conspiring with the general tendency of the sixteenth century
throughout Europe, the feudal spirit would be weakened and
kept under in Scotland or display itself only in a parliamentary
resistance to what might become in its turn dangerous, the encroachments
of arbitrary power. But immediately afterwards
a new and unexpected impulse was given; religious zeal, so
blended with the ancient spirit of aristocratic independence that
the two motives are scarcely distinguishable, swept before it in
the first whirlwind almost every vestige of the royal sovereignty.
The Roman catholic religion was abolished with the forms indeed
of a parliament, but of a parliament not summoned by the
Crown, and by acts that obtained not its assent. The Scots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
church had been immensely rich; its riches had led, as everywhere
else, to neglect of duties and dissoluteness of life; and
these vices had met with their usual punishment in the people's
hatred.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
 The reformed doctrines gained a more rapid and
general ascendancy than in England, and were accompanied
with a more strenuous and uncompromising enthusiasm. It is
probable that no sovereign retaining a strong attachment to
the ancient creed would long have been permitted to reign;
and Mary is entitled to every presumption, in the great controversy
that belongs to her name, that can reasonably be founded
on this admission. But, without deviating into that long and
intricate discussion, it may be given as the probable result of
fair inquiry, that to impeach the characters of most of her
adversaries would be a far easier task than to exonerate her own.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Power of the presbyterian clergy.</i>&mdash;The history of Scotland from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the reformation assumes a character, not only unlike that of
preceding times, but to which there is no parallel in modern
ages. It became a contest, not between the Crown and the
feudal aristocracy as before, nor between the assertors of prerogative
and of privilege, as in England, nor between the
possessors of established power and those who deemed themselves
oppressed by it, as is the usual source of civil discord,
but between the temporal and spiritual authorities, the Crown
and the church; that in general supported by the legislature,
this sustained by the voice of the people. Nothing of this kind,
at least in anything like so great a degree, has occurred in other
protestant countries; the Anglican church being, in its original
constitution, bound up with the state as one of its component
parts, but subordinate to the whole; and the ecclesiastical
order in the kingdoms and commonwealths of the continent
being either destitute of temporal authority, or at least subject
to the civil magistrate's supremacy.</p>

<p>Knox, the founder of the Scots' reformation, and those who
concurred with him, both adhered to the theological system of
Calvin, and to the scheme of polity he had introduced at Geneva,
with such modifications as became necessary from the greater
scale on which it was to be practised. Each parish had its
minister, lay-elder, and deacon, who held their kirk-session for
spiritual jurisdiction and other purposes; each ecclesiastical province
its synod of ministers and delegated elders presided over
by a superintendent; but the supreme power resided in the
general assembly of the Scots' church, constituted of all ministers
of parishes, with an admixture of delegated laymen, to which
appeals from inferior judicatories lay, and by whose determinations
or canons the whole were bound. The superintendents
had such a degree of episcopal authority as seems implied in their
name, but concurrently with the parochial ministers, and in
subordination to the general assembly; the number of these
was designed to be ten, but only five were appointed.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
 This
form of church polity was set up in 1560; but according to the
irregular state of things at that time in Scotland, though fully
admitted and acted upon, it had only the authority of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
church, with no confirmation of parliament; which seems to
have been the first step of the former towards the independency
it came to usurp. Meanwhile it was agreed that the Roman
catholic prelates, including the regulars, should enjoy two-thirds
of their revenues, as well as their rank and seats in parliament;
the remaining third being given to the Crown, out of which
stipends should be allotted to the protestant clergy. Whatever
violence may be imputed to the authors of the Scots' reformation,
this arrangement seems to display a moderation which we
should vainly seek in our own. The new church was, however,
but inadequately provided for; and perhaps we may attribute
some part of her subsequent contumacy and encroachment on
the state to the exasperation occasioned by the latter's parsimony,
or rather rapaciousness, in the distribution of ecclesiastical
estates.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
</p>

<p>It was doubtless intended by the planners of a presbyterian
model, that the bishoprics should be extinguished by the death
of the possessors, and their revenues be converted, partly to the
maintenance of the clergy, partly to other public interests. But
it suited better the men in power to keep up the old appellations
for their own benefit. As the catholic prelates died away, they
were replaced by protestant ministers, on private compacts to
alienate the principal part of the revenues to those through
whom they were appointed. After some hesitation, a convention
of the church, in 1572, agreed to recognise these bishops,
until the king's majority and a final settlement by the legislature,
and to permit them a certain portion of jurisdiction, though not
greater than that of the superintendent, and equally subordinate
to the general assembly. They were not consecrated; nor
would the slightest distinction of order have been endured by
the church. Yet even this moderated episcopacy gave offence
to ardent men, led by Andrew Melville, the second name to Knox
in the ecclesiastical history of Scotland; and, notwithstanding
their engagement to leave things as they were till the determination
of parliament, the general assembly soon began to
restrain the bishops by their own authority, and finally to enjoin
them, under pain of excommunication, to lay down an office
which they voted to be destitute of warrant from the word of
God, and injurious to the church. Some of the bishops submitted
to this decree; others, as might be expected, stood out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
in defence of their dignity, and were supported both by the
king and by all who conceived that the supreme power of
Scotland, in establishing and endowing the church, had not
constituted a society independent of the commonwealth. A
series of acts in 1584, at a time when the court had obtained a
temporary ascendant, seemed to restore the episcopal government
in almost its pristine lustre. But the popular voice was
loud against episcopacy; the prelates were discredited by their
simoniacal alienations of church-revenues, and by their connection
with the court; the king was tempted to annex most of
their lands to the Crown by an act of parliament in 1587;
Adamson, Archbishop of St. Andrews, who had led the episcopal
party, was driven to a humiliating retractation before the general
assembly; and, in 1592, the sanction of the legislature was for
the first time obtained to the whole scheme of presbyterian
polity; and the laws of 1584 were for the most part abrogated.</p>

<p>The school of Knox, if so we may call the early presbyterian
ministers of Scotland, was full of men breathing their master's
spirit; acute in disputation, eloquent in discourse, learned
beyond what their successors have been, and intensely zealous
in the cause of reformation. They wielded the people at will;
who, except in the Highlands, threw off almost with unanimity
the old religion, and took alarm at the slightest indication of its
revival. Their system of local and general assemblies infused,
together with the forms of a republic, its energy and impatience
of exterior control, combined with the concentration and unity of
purpose that belongs to the most vigorous government. It must
be confessed that the unsettled state of the kingdom, the faults
and weakness of the regents Lennox and Morton, the inauspicious
beginning of James's personal administration under the sway of
unworthy favourites, the real perils of the reformed church, gave
no slight pretext for the clergy's interference with civil policy.
Not merely in their representative assemblies, but in the pulpits,
they perpetually remonstrated, in no guarded language, against
the misgovernment of the court, and even the personal indiscretions
of the king. This they pretended to claim as a privilege
beyond the restraint of law. Andrew Melville, second only to
Knox among the heroes of the presbyterian church, having been
summoned before the council in 1584, to give an account of some
seditious language alleged to have been used by him in the pulpit,
declined its jurisdiction, on the ground that he was only
responsible, in the first instance, to his presbytery for words so
spoken, of which the king and council could not judge without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
violating the immunities of the church. Precedents for such an
immunity it would not have been difficult to find; but they must
have been sought in the archives of the enemy. It was rather
early for the new republic to emulate the despotism she had
overthrown. Such, however, is the uniformity with which the
same passions operate on bodies of men in similar circumstances;
and so greedily do those, whose birth has placed them far beneath
the possession of power, intoxicate themselves with its unaccustomed
enjoyments. It has been urged in defence of
Melville, that he only denied the competence of a secular
tribunal in the first instance; and that, after the ecclesiastical
forum had pronounced on the spiritual offence, it was not
disputed that the civil magistrate might vindicate his own
authority.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
 But not to mention that Melville's claim, as I
understand it, was to be judged by his presbytery in the first
instance, and ultimately by the general assembly, from which,
according to the presbyterian theory, no appeal lay to a civil
court; it is manifest that the government would have come to
a very disadvantageous conflict with a man, to whose defence
the ecclesiastical judicature had already pledged itself. For in
the temper of those times it was easy to foresee the determination
of a synod or presbytery.</p>

<p>James however and his counsellors were not so feeble as to
endure this open renewal of those extravagant pretensions which
Rome had taught her priesthood to assert. Melville fled to
England; and a parliament that met the same year sustained
the supremacy of the civil power with that violence and dangerous
latitude of expression so frequent in the Scots' statute-book.
It was made treason to decline the jurisdiction of the king or
council in any matter, to seek the diminution of the power of
any of the three estates of parliament, which struck at all that
had been done against episcopacy, to utter, or to conceal, when
heard from others in sermons or familiar discourse, any false or
slanderous speeches to the reproach of the king, his council, or
their proceedings, or to the dishonour of his parents and progenitors,
or to meddle in the affairs of state. It was forbidden
to treat or consult on any matter of state, civil or ecclesiastical,
without the king's express command; thus rendering the general
assembly for its chief purposes, if not its existence, altogether
dependent on the Crown. Such laws not only annihilated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
pretended immunities of the church, but went very far to set up
that tyranny, which the Stuarts afterwards exercised in Scotland
till their expulsion. These were in part repealed, so far as
affected the church, in 1592; but the Crown retained the exclusive
right of convening its general assembly, to which the presbyterian
hierarchy still gives but an evasive and reluctant
obedience.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
</p>

<p>These bold demagogues were not long in availing themselves
of the advantage which they had obtained in the parliament of
1592, and through the troubled state of the realm. They began
again to intermeddle with public affairs, the administration of
which was sufficiently open to censure. This licence brought
on a new crisis in 1596. Black, one of the ministers of St.
Andrews, inveighing against the government from the pulpit,
painted the king and queen, as well as their council, in the
darkest colours, as dissembling enemies to religion. James,
incensed at this attack, caused him to be summoned before the
privy council. The clergy decided to make common cause with
the accused. The council of the church, a standing committee
lately appointed by the general assembly, enjoined Black to
decline the jurisdiction. The king by proclamation directed
the members of this council to retire to their several parishes.
They resolved, instead of submitting, that since they were
convened by the warrant of Christ, in a most needful and
dangerous time, to see unto the good of the church, they should
obey God rather than man. The king offered to stop the proceedings,
if they would but declare that they did not decline
the civil jurisdiction absolutely, but only in the particular case,
as being one of slander, and consequently of ecclesiastical competence.
For Black had asserted before the council, that
speeches delivered in the pulpits, although alleged to be treasonable,
could not be judged by the king, until the church had first
taken cognisance thereof. But these ecclesiastics, in the full
spirit of the thirteenth century, determined by a majority not
to recede from their plea. Their contest with the court soon
excited the populace of Edinburgh, and gave rise to a tumult,
which, whether dangerous or not to the king, was what no
government could pass over without utter loss of authority.</p>

<p>It was in church assemblies alone that James found opposition.
His parliament, as had invariably been the case in Scotland,
went readily into all that was proposed to them; nor can
we doubt that the gentry must for the most part have revolted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
from these insolent usurpations of the ecclesiastical order. It
was ordained in parliament, that every minister should declare
his submission to the king's jurisdiction in all matters civil and
criminal; that no ecclesiastical judicatory should meet without
the king's consent, and that a magistrate might commit to
prison any minister reflecting in his sermons on the king's
conduct. He had next recourse to an instrument of power
more successful frequently than intimidation, and generally
successful in conjunction with it; gaining over the members
of the general assembly, some by promises, some by exciting
jealousies, till they surrendered no small portion of what had
passed for the privileges of the church. The Crown obtained
by their concession, which then seemed almost necessary to
confirm what the legislature had enacted, the right of convoking
assemblies, and of nominating ministers in the principal
towns.</p>

<p><i>Establishment of episcopacy.</i>&mdash;James followed up this victory
by a still more important blow. It was enacted that fifty-one
ministers, on being nominated by the king to titular bishoprics
and other prelacies, might sit in parliament as representatives
of the church. This seemed justly alarming to the zealots of
party; nor could the general assembly be brought to acquiesce
without such very considerable restrictions upon these suspicious
commissioners, by which name they prevailed to have
them called, as might in some measure afford security against
the revival of that episcopal domination, towards which the
endeavours of the Crown were plainly directed. But the king
paid little regard to these regulations; and thus the name
and parliamentary station of bishops were restored in Scotland
after only six years from their abolition.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
</p>

<p>A king like James, not less conceited of his wisdom than full
of the dignity of his station, could not avoid contracting that
insuperable aversion to the Scottish presbytery, which he
expressed in his <i>Basilicon Doron</i>, before his accession to the
English throne, and more vehemently on all occasions afterwards.
He found a very different race of churchmen, well
trained in the supple school of courtly conformity, and emulous
flatterers both of his power and his wisdom. The ministers of
Edinburgh had been used to pray that God would turn his
heart: Whitgift, at the conference of Hampton Court, falling
on his knees, exclaimed, that he doubted not his majesty spoke
by the special grace of God. It was impossible that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
not redouble his endeavours to introduce so convenient a system
of ecclesiastical government into his native kingdom. He
began, accordingly, to prevent the meetings of the general
assembly by continued prorogations. Some hardy presbyterians
ventured to assemble of their own authority; which the
lawyers construed into treason. The bishops were restored by
parliament, in 1606, to a part of their revenues; the act annexing
these to the Crown being repealed. They were appointed
by an ecclesiastical convention, more subservient to the Crown
than formerly, to be perpetual moderators of provincial synods.
The clergy still gave way with reluctance; but the Crown
had an irresistible ascendancy in parliament; and in 1610 the
episcopal system was thoroughly established. The powers of
ordination, as well as jurisdiction, were solely vested in the
prelates; a court of high commission was created on the English
model; and, though the general assembly of the church still
continued, it was merely as a shadow, and almost mockery, of
its original importance. The bishops now repaired to England
for consecration; a ceremony deemed essential in the new
school that now predominated in the Anglican church; and
this gave a final blow to the polity in which the Scottish reformation
had been founded.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
 With far more questionable prudence,
James, some years afterwards, forced upon the people of
Scotland what were called the five articles of Perth, reluctantly
adopted by a general assembly held there in 1617. These were
matters of ceremony, such as the posture of kneeling in the
eucharist, the rite of confirmation, and the observance of certain
holidays; but enough to alarm a nation fanatically abhorrent
of every approximation to the Roman worship, and already
incensed by what they deemed the corruption and degradation
of their church.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
</p>

<p>That church, if indeed it preserved its identity, was wholly
changed in character; and became as much distinguished in its
episcopal form by servility and corruption as during its presbyterian
democracy by faction and turbulence. The bishops at
its head, many of them abhorred by their own countrymen as
apostates and despised for their vices, looked for protection to
the sister church of England in its pride and triumph. It had
long been the favourite project of the court, as it naturally was
of the Anglican prelates, to assimilate in all respects the two
establishments. That of Scotland still wanted one essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
characteristic, a regular liturgy. But in preparing what was
called the service book, the English model was not closely
followed; the variations having all a tendency towards the
Romish worship. It is far more probable that Laud intended
these to prepare the way for a similar change in England, than
that, as some have surmised, the Scottish bishops, from a notion
of independence, chose thus to distinguish their own ritual.
What were the consequences of this unhappy innovation,
attempted with that ignorance of mankind which kings and
priests, when left to their own guidance, usually display, it is
here needless to mention. In its ultimate results, it preserved
the liberties and overthrew the monarchy of England. In its
more immediate effects, it gave rise to the national covenant of
Scotland; a solemn pledge of unity and perseverance in a great
public cause, long since devised when the Spanish armada
threatened the liberties and religion of all Britain, but now
directed against the domestic enemies of both. The episcopal
government had no friends, even among those who served the
king. To him it was dear by the sincerest conviction, and by
its connection with absolute power, still more close and direct
than in England. But he had reduced himself to a condition
where it was necessary to sacrifice his authority in the smaller
kingdom, if he would hope to preserve it in the greater; and
in this view he consented, in the parliament of 1641, to restore
the presbyterian discipline of the Scottish church; an offence
against his conscience (for such his prejudices led him to
consider it) which he deeply afterwards repented, when he
discovered how absolutely it had failed of serving his interests.</p>

<p><i>Innovations of Charles I.</i>&mdash;In the great struggle with Charles
against episcopacy, the encroachments of arbitrary rule, for
the sake of which, in a great measure, he valued that form of
church polity, were not overlooked; and the parliament of 1641
procured some essential improvements in the civil constitution
of Scotland. Triennial sessions of the legislature, and other
salutary reformations, were borrowed from their friends and
coadjutors in England. But what was still more important,
was the abolition of that destructive control over the legislature,
which the Crown had obtained through the lords of articles.
These had doubtless been originally nominated by the several
estates in parliament, solely to expedite the management of
business, and relieve the entire body from attention to it. But,
as early as 1561, we find a practice established, that the spiritual
lords should choose the temporal, generally eight in number,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
who were to sit on this committee, and conversely; the burgesses
still electing their own. To these it became usual to add
some of the officers of state; and in 1617 it was established that
eight of them should be on the list. Charles procured, without
authority of parliament, a further innovation in 1633. The
bishops chose eight peers, the peers eight bishops; and these
appointed sixteen commissioners of shires and boroughs. Thus
the whole power devolved upon the bishops, the slaves and
sycophants of the Crown. The parliament itself met only on
two days, the first and last of their pretended session, the one
time in order to choose the lords of articles, the other, to ratify
what they proposed.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
 So monstrous an anomaly could not long
subsist in a high-spirited nation. This improvident assumption
of power by low-born and odious men precipitated their downfall,
and made the destruction of the hierarchy appear the
necessary guarantee for parliamentary independence, and the
ascendant of the aristocracy. But, lest the court might, in
some other form, regain this preliminary or initiative voice in
legislation, which the experience of many governments has
shown to be the surest method of keeping supreme authority
in their hands, it was enacted in 1641, that each estate might
choose lords of articles or not, at its discretion; but that all
propositions should in the first instance be submitted to the
whole parliament, by whom such only as should be thought
fitting might be referred to the committee of articles for consideration.</p>

<p><i>Arbitrary government.</i>&mdash;This parliament, however, neglected
to abolish one of the most odious engines that tyranny ever
devised against public virtue, the Scots law of treason. It had
been enacted by a statute of James I. in 1424, that all leasing-makers,
and tellers of what might engender discord between
the king and his people, should forfeit life and goods.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
 This act
was renewed under James II. It was aimed at the factious
aristocracy, who perpetually excited the people by invidious
reproaches against the king's administration. But in 1584, a
new antagonist to the Crown having appeared in the presbyterian
pulpits, it was determined to silence opposition by giving
the statute of leasing-making, as it was denominated, a more
sweeping operation. Its penalties were accordingly extended
to such as should "utter untrue or slanderous speeches, to the
disdain, reproach, and contempt of his highness, his parents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and progenitors, or should meddle in the affairs of his highness
or his estate." The "hearers and not reporters thereof" were
subjected to the same punishment. It may be remarked that
these Scots statutes are worded with a latitude never found in
England, even in the worst times of Henry VIII. Lord Balmerino,
who had opposed the court in the parliament of 1633,
retained in his possession a copy of an apology intended to have
been presented by himself and other peers in their exculpation,
but from which they had desisted, in apprehension of the king's
displeasure. This was obtained clandestinely, and in breach of
confidence, by some of his enemies; and he was indicted on the
statute of leasing-making, as having concealed a slander against
his majesty's government. A jury was returned with gross
partiality; yet so outrageous was the attempted violation of
justice that Balmerino was only convicted by a majority of
eight against seven. For in Scots juries a simple majority was
sufficient, as it is still in all cases except treason. It was not
thought expedient to carry this sentence into execution; but
the kingdom could never pardon its government so infamous a
stretch of power.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
 The statute itself however seems not to
have shared the same odium; we do not find any effort made
for its repeal; and the ruling party in 1641, unfortunately, did
not scruple to make use of its sanguinary provisions against
their own adversaries.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
</p>

<p>The conviction of Balmerino is hardly more repugnant to
justice than some other cases in the long reign of James VI.
Eight years after the execution of the Earl of Gowrie and his
brother, one Sprot, a notary, having indiscreetly mentioned
that he was in possession of letters, written by a person since
dead, which evinced his participation in that mysterious conspiracy,
was put to death for concealing them.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
 Thomas Ross
suffered, in 1618, the punishment of treason for publishing at
Oxford a blasphemous libel, as the indictment calls it, against
the Scots nation.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
 I know not what he could have said worse
than what their sentence against him enabled others to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
that, amidst a great vaunt of Christianity and civilisation, they
took away men's lives by such statutes, and such constructions
of them, as could only be paralleled in the annals of the worst
tyrants. By an act of 1584, the privy council were empowered
to examine an accused party on oath; and, if he declined to
answer any question, it was held denial of their jurisdiction,
and amounted to a conviction of treason. This was experienced
by two jesuits, Crighton and Ogilvy in 1610 and 1615, the latter
of whom was executed.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
 One of the statutes upon which he
was indicted contained the singular absurdity of "annulling
and rescinding everything done, or hereafter to be done, in
prejudice of the royal prerogative, in any time bygone or to
come."</p>

<p><i>Civil war.</i>&mdash;It was perhaps impossible that Scotland should remain
indifferent in the great quarrel of the sister kingdom. But
having set her heart upon two things incompatible in themselves
from the outset, according to the circumstances of England,
and both of them ultimately impracticable, the continuance
of Charles on the throne and the establishment of a presbyterian
church, she fell into a long course of disaster and ignominy,
till she held the name of a free constitution at the will of a
conqueror. Of the three most conspicuous among her nobility
in this period, each died by the hand of the executioner; but
the resemblance is in nothing besides; and the characters of
Hamilton, Montrose, and Argyle are not less contrasted than
the factions of which they were the leaders. Humbled and
broken down, the people looked to the re-establishment of
Charles II. on the throne of his fathers, though brought about
by the sternest minister of Cromwell's tyranny, not only as the
augury of prosperous days, but as the obliteration of public
dishonour.</p>

<p><i>Tyrannical government of Charles II.</i>&mdash;They were miserably
deceived in every hope. Thirty infamous years consummated
the misfortunes and degradation of Scotland. Her factions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
have always been more sanguinary, her rulers more oppressive,
her sense of justice and humanity less active, or at least shown
less in public acts, than can be charged against England. The
parliament of 1661, influenced by wicked statesmen and lawyers,
left far behind the Royalist Commons of London; and rescinded
as null the entire acts of 1641, on the absurd pretext that the
late king had passed them through force. The Scots' constitution
fell back at once to a state little better than despotism.
The lords of articles were revived, according to the same form
of election as under Charles I. A few years afterwards the
Duke of Lauderdale obtained the consent of parliament to an
act, that whatever the king and council should order respecting
all ecclesiastical matters, meetings, and persons, should have
the force of law. A militia, or rather army, of 22,000 men, was
established, to march wherever the council should appoint, and
the honour and safety of the king require. Fines to the amount
of £85,000, an enormous sum in that kingdom, were imposed on
the covenanters. The Earl of Argyle brought to the scaffold
by an outrageous sentence, his son sentenced to lose his life on
such a construction of the ancient law against leasing-making
as no man engaged in political affairs could be sure to escape,
the worst system of constitutional laws administered by the
worst men, left no alternative but implicit obedience or desperate
rebellion.</p>

<p>The presbyterian church of course fell by the act, which
annulled the parliament wherein it had been established. Episcopacy
revived, but not as it had once existed in Scotland; the
jurisdiction of the bishops became unlimited; the general
assemblies, so dear to the people, were laid aside.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
 The new
prelates were odious as apostates, and soon gained a still more
indelible title to popular hatred as persecutors. Three hundred
and fifty of the presbyterian clergy (more than one-third of the
whole number) were ejected from their benefices.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
 Then began
the preaching in conventicles, and the secession of the excited
and exasperated multitude from the churches; and then ensued
the ecclesiastical commission with its inquisitorial vigilance, its
fines and corporal penalties, and the free quarters of the soldiery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
with all that can be implied in that word. Then came the
fruitless insurrection, and the fanatical assurance of success,
and the certain discomfiture by a disciplined force, and the
consternation of defeat, and the unbounded cruelties of the
conqueror. And this went on with perpetual aggravation, or
very rare intervals, through the reign of Charles; the tyranny
of Lauderdale far exceeding that of Middleton, as his own fell
short of the Duke of York's. No part, I believe, of modern
history for so long a period, can be compared for the wickedness
of government to the Scots administration of this reign. In
proportion as the laws grew more rigorous against the presbyterian
worship, its followers evinced more steadiness; driven
from their conventicles, they resorted, sometimes by night, to
the fields, the woods, the mountains; and, as the troops were
continually employed to disperse them, they came with arms
which they were often obliged to use; and thus the hour, the
place, the circumstance, deepened every impression, and bound
up their faith with indissoluble associations. The same causes
produced a dark fanaticism, which believed the revenge of its
own wrongs to be the execution of divine justice; and, as this
acquired new strength by every successive aggravation of
tyranny, it is literally possible that a continuance of the Stuart
government might have led to something very like an extermination
of the people in the western counties of Scotland. In the
year 1676 letters of intercommuning were published; a writ
forbidding all persons to hold intercourse with the parties put
under its ban, or to furnish them with any necessary of life on
pain of being reputed guilty of the same crime. But seven
years afterwards, when the Cameronian rebellion had assumed
a dangerous character, a proclamation was issued against all
who had ever harboured or communed with rebels; courts were
appointed to be held for their trial as traitors, which were to
continue for the next three years. Those who accepted the
test, a declaration of passive obedience repugnant to the conscience
of the presbyterians, and imposed for that reason in
1681, were excused from these penalties; and in this way they
were eluded.</p>

<p>The enormities of this detestable government are far too
numerous, even in species, to be enumerated in this slight
sketch; and of course most instances of cruelty have not been
recorded. The privy council was accustomed to extort confessions
by torture; that grim divan of bishops, lawyers, and
peers sucking in the groans of each undaunted enthusiast, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
hope that some imperfect avowal might lead to the sacrifice of
other victims, or at least warrant the execution of the present.
It is said that the Duke of York, whose conduct in Scotland
tends to efface those sentiments of pity and respect which other
parts of his life might excite, used to assist himself on these
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
 One Mitchell having been induced, by a promise
that his life should be spared, to confess an attempt to assassinate
Sharp the primate, was brought to trial some years afterwards;
when four lords of the council deposed on oath that no
such assurance had been given him; and Sharp insisted upon his
execution. The vengeance ultimately taken on this infamous
apostate and persecutor, though doubtless in violation of what
is justly reckoned an universal rule of morality, ought at least
not to weaken our abhorrence of the man himself.</p>

<p>The test above mentioned was imposed by parliament in
1681, and contained, among other things, an engagement never
to attempt any alteration of government in church or state.
The Earl of Argyle, son of him who had perished by an unjust
sentence, and himself once before attainted by another, though
at that time restored by the king, was still destined to illustrate
the house of Campbell by a second martyrdom. He refused to
subscribe the test without the reasonable explanation that he
would not bind himself from attempting, in his station, any
improvement in church or state. This exposed him to an
accusation of leasing-making (the old mystery of iniquity in
Scots law) and of treason. He was found guilty through the
astonishing audacity of the Crown lawyers and servility of the
judges and jury. It is not perhaps certain that his immediate
execution would have ensued; but no man ever trusted securely
to the mercies of the Stuarts, and Argyle escaped in disguise by
the aid of his daughter-in-law. The council proposed that this
lady should be publicly whipped; but there was an excess of
atrocity in the Scots on the court side, which no Englishman
could reach; and the Duke of York felt as a gentleman upon
such a suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
 The Earl of Argyle was brought to the
scaffold a few years afterwards on the old sentence; but after
his unfortunate rebellion, which of course would have legally
justified his execution.</p>

<p>The Cameronians, a party rendered wild and fanatical through
intolerable oppression, published a declaration, wherein, after
renouncing their allegiance to Charles, and expressing their
abhorrence of murder on the score of religion, they announced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
their determination of retaliating, according to their power, on
such privy counsellors, officers in command, or others, as should
continue to seek their blood. The fate of Sharp was thus
before the eyes of all who emulated his crimes; and in terror
the council ordered that whoever refused to disown this declaration
on oath, should be put to death in the presence of two
witnesses. Every officer, every soldier, was thus entrusted with
the privilege of massacre; the unarmed, the women and children,
fell indiscriminately by the sword: and besides the distinct
testimonies that remain of atrocious cruelty, there exists in that
kingdom a deep traditional horror, the record, as it were, of
that confused mass of crime and misery which has left no other
memorial.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Reign of James VII.</i>&mdash;A parliament summoned by James on
his accession, with an intimation from the throne that they
were assembled not only to express their own duty, but to set
an example of compliance to England, gave, without the least
opposition, the required proofs of loyalty. They acknowledged
the king's absolute power, declared their abhorrence of any
principle derogatory to it, professed an unreserved obedience
in all cases, bestowed a large revenue for life. They enhanced
the penalties against sectaries; a refusal to give evidence against
traitors or other delinquents was made equivalent to a conviction
of the same offence; it was capital to preach even in houses,
or to hear preachers in the fields. The persecution raged with
still greater fury in the first part of this reign. But the same
repugnance of the episcopal party to the king's schemes for
his own religion, which led to his remarkable change of policy
in England, produced similar effects in Scotland. He had
attempted to obtain from parliament a repeal of the penal laws
and the test; but, though an extreme servility or a general
intimidation made the nobility acquiesce in his propositions,
and two of the bishops were gained over, yet the commissioners
of shires and boroughs, who voting promiscuously in the house,
had, when united, a majority over the peers, so firmly resisted
every encroachment of popery, that it was necessary to try
other methods than those of parliamentary enactment. After
the dissolution the dispensing power was brought into play;
the privy council forbade the execution of the laws against the
catholics; several of that religion were introduced to its board;
the royal boroughs were deprived of their privileges, the king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
assuming the nomination of their chief magistrates, so as to
throw the elections wholly into the hands of the Crown. A
declaration of indulgence, emanating from the king's absolute
prerogative, relaxed the severity of the laws against presbyterian
conventicles, and, annulling the oath of supremacy and
the test of 1681, substituted for them an oath of allegiance,
acknowledging his power to be unlimited. He promised at the
same time that "he would use no force nor invincible necessity
against any man on account of his persuasion, or the protestant
religion, nor would deprive the possessors of lands formerly
belonging to the church." A very intelligible hint that the
protestant religion was to exist only by this gracious sufferance.</p>

<p><i>Revolution and establishment of presbytery.</i>&mdash;The oppressed
presbyterians gained some respite by this indulgence, though
instances of executions under the sanguinary statutes of the
late reign are found as late as the beginning of 1688. But the
memory of their sufferings was indelible; they accepted, but
with no gratitude, the insidious mercy of a tyrant they abhorred.
The Scots' conspiracy with the Prince of Orange went forward
simultaneously with that of England; it included several of
the council, from personal jealousy, dislike of the king's proceedings
as to religion, or anxiety to secure an indemnity they
had little deserved in the approaching crisis. The people rose
in different parts; the Scots' nobility and gentry in London
presented an address to the Prince of Orange, requesting him
to call a convention of the estates; and this irregular summons
was universally obeyed.</p>

<p>The king was not without friends in this convention; but the
whigs had from every cause a decided preponderance. England
had led the way; William was on his throne; the royal government
at home was wholly dissolved; and, after enumerating in
fifteen articles the breaches committed on the constitution, the
estates came to a resolution: "That James VII., being a professed
papist, did assume the royal power, and acted as king,
without ever taking the oath required by law, and had, by the
advice of evil and wicked counsellors, invaded the fundamental
constitution of the kingdom, and altered it from a legal limited
monarchy to an arbitrary despotic power, and hath exerted
the same to the subversion of the protestant religion, and the
violation of the laws and liberties of the kingdom, whereby he
hath forfaulted (forfeited) his right to the Crown, and the throne
has become vacant." It was evident that the English vote of
a constructive abdication, having been partly grounded on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
king's flight, could not without still greater violence be applied
to Scotland; and consequently the bolder denomination of
forfeiture was necessarily employed to express the penalty of
his mis-government. There was, in fact, a very striking difference
in the circumstances of the two kingdoms. In the one,
there had been illegal acts and unjustifiable severities; but it
was, at first sight, no very strong case for national resistance,
which stood rather on a calculation of expediency than an
instinct of self-preservation or an impulse of indignant revenge.
But in the other, it had been a tyranny, dark as that of the most
barbarous ages; despotism, which in England was scarcely in
blossom, had borne its bitter and poisonous fruits: no word of
slighter import than forfeiture could be chosen to denote the
national rejection of the Stuart line.</p>

<p><i>Reign of William III.</i>&mdash;A declaration and claim of rights was
drawn up, as in England, together with the resolution that the
crown be tendered to William and Mary, and descend afterwards
in conformity with the limitations enacted in the sister kingdom.
This declaration excluded papists from the throne, and asserted
the illegality of proclamations to dispense with statutes, of the
inflicting capital punishment without jury, of imprisonment
without special cause or delay of trial, of exacting enormous
fines, of nominating the magistrates in boroughs, and several
other violent proceedings in the two last reigns. These articles
the convention challenged as their undoubted right, against
which no declaration nor precedent ought to operate. They
reserved some other important grievances to be redressed in
parliament. Upon this occasion, a noble fire of liberty shone
forth to the honour of Scotland, amidst those scenes of turbulent
faction or servile corruption which the annals of her parliament
so perpetually display. They seemed emulous of English
freedom, and proud to place their own imperfect commonwealth
on as firm a basis.</p>

<p>One great alteration in the state of Scotland was almost
necessarily involved in the fall of the Stuarts. Their most
conspicuous object had been the maintenance of the episcopal
church; the line was drawn far more closely than in England;
in that church were the court's friends, out of it were its
opponents. Above all, the people were out of it, and in a
revolution brought about by the people, their voice could not
be slighted. It was one of the articles accordingly in the declaration
of rights, that prelacy and precedence in ecclesiastical office
were repugnant to the genius of a nation reformed by presbyters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
and an unsupportable grievance which ought to be abolished.
William, there is reason to believe, had offered to preserve the
bishops, in return for their support in the convention. But
this, not more happily for Scotland than for himself and his
successors, they refused to give. No compromise, or even
acknowledged toleration, was practicable in that country
between two exasperated factions; but, if oppression was
necessary, it was at least not on the majority that it ought to
fall. But besides this, there was as clear a case of forfeiture in
the Scots' episcopal church, as in the royal family of Stuart.
The main controversy between the episcopal and presbyterian
churches was one of dry antiquarian criticism, little more
interesting than those about the Roman senate, or the Saxon
wittenagemot, nor perhaps more capable of decisive solution;
it was at least one as to which the bulk of mankind are absolutely
incapable of forming a rational judgment for themselves. But,
mingled up as it had always been, and most of all in Scotland,
with faction, with revolution, with power and emolument, with
courage and devotion, and fear, and hate, and revenge, this arid
dispute of pedants drew along with it the most glowing emotions
of the heart, and the question became utterly out of the province
of argument. It was very possible that episcopacy might be of
apostolical institution; but for this institution houses had been
burned and fields laid waste, and the gospel had been preached
in wildernesses, and its ministers had been shot in their prayers,
and husbands had been murdered before their wives, and virgins
had been defiled, and many had died by the executioner, and by
massacre, and in imprisonment, and in exile and slavery, and
women had been tied to stakes on the sea-shore till the tide rose
to overflow them, and some had been tortured and mutilated;
it was a religion of the boots and the thumb-screw, which a good
man must be very cool-blooded indeed if he did not hate and
reject from the hands which offered it. For, after all, it is much
more certain that the Supreme Being abhors cruelty and persecution,
than that he has set up bishops to have a superiority over
presbyters.</p>

<p>It was, however, a serious problem at that time, whether the
presbyterian church, so proud and stubborn as she had formerly
shown herself, could be brought under a necessary subordination
to the civil magistrate, and whether the more fanatical part of
it, whom Cargill and Cameron had led on, would fall again into
the ranks of social life. But here experience victoriously confuted
these plausible apprehensions. It was soon perceived that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the insanity of fanaticism subsides of itself, unless purposely
heightened by persecution. The fiercer spirit of the sectaries
was allayed by degrees; and, though vestiges of it may probably
still be perceptible by observers, it has never, in a political sense,
led to dangerous effects. The church of Scotland, in her general
assemblies, preserves the forms, and affects the language, of
the sixteenth century; but the Erastianism, against which she
inveighs, secretly controls and paralyses her vaunted liberties;
and she cannot but acknowledge that the supremacy of the
legislature is like the collar of the watch-dog, the price of food
and shelter, and the condition upon which alone a religious
society can be endowed and established by any prudent commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>

The judicious admixture of laymen in these assemblies,
and, in a far greater degree, the perpetual intercourse with
England, which has put an end to everything like sectarian
bigotry, and even exclusive communion, in the higher and
middling classes, are the principal causes of that remarkable
moderation which for many years has characterised the successors
of Knox and Melville.</p>

<p>The convention of estates was turned by an act of its own
into a parliament, and continued to sit during the king's reign.
This, which was rather contrary to the spirit of a representative
government than to the Scots constitution, might be justified
by the very unquiet state of the kingdom and the intrigues of
the jacobites. Many excellent statutes were enacted in this
parliament, besides the provisions included in the declaration of
rights; twenty-six members were added to the representation of
the counties, the tyrannous acts of the two last reigns were
repealed, the unjust attainders were reversed, the lords of
articles were abolished. After some years, an act was obtained
against wrongous imprisonment, still more effectual perhaps in
some respects than that of the habeas corpus in England. The
prisoner is to be released on bail within twenty-four hours on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
application to a judge, unless committed on a capital charge;
and in that case must be brought to trial within sixty days. A
judge refusing to give full effect to the act is declared incapable
of public trust.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these great improvements in the constitution,
and the cessation of religious tyranny, the Scots are not accustomed
to look back on the reign of William with much complacency.
The regeneration was far from perfect; the court of
session continued to be corrupt and partial; severe and illegal
proceedings might sometimes be imputed to the council; and
in one lamentable instance, the massacre of the Macdonalds in
Glencoe, the deliberate crime of some statesmen tarnished not
slightly the bright fame of their deceived master: though it was
not for the adherents of the house of Stuart, under whom so
many deeds of more extensive slaughter had been perpetrated,
to fill Europe with their invectives against this military execution.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>

The episcopal clergy, driven out injuriously by the
populace from their livings, were permitted after a certain time
to hold them again in some instances under certain conditions;
but William, perhaps almost the only consistent friend of
toleration in his kingdoms, at least among public men, lost by
this indulgence the affection of one party, without in the slightest
degree conciliating the other.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
 The true cause, however, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
prevalent disaffection at this period was the condition of Scotland,
an ancient, independent kingdom, inhabited by a proud,
high-spirited people, relatively to another kingdom, which they
had long regarded with enmity, still with jealousy; but to
which, in despite of their theoretical equality, they were kept in
subordination by an insurmountable necessity. The union of
the two crowns had withdrawn their sovereign and his court;
yet their government had been national, and on the whole with
no great intermixture of English influence. Many reasons,
however, might be given for a more complete incorporation,
which had been the favourite project of James I., and was
discussed, at least on the part of Scotland, by commissioners
appointed in 1670. That treaty failed of making any progress;
the terms proposed being such as the English parliament would
never have accepted. At the revolution a similar plan was just
hinted, and abandoned. Meanwhile, the new character that
the English government had assumed rendered it more difficult
to preserve the actual connection. A king of both countries,
especially by origin more allied to the weaker, might maintain
some impartiality in his behaviour towards each of them. But,
if they were to be ruled, in effect, nearly as two republics; that
is, if the power of their parliaments should be so much enhanced
as ultimately to determine the principal measures of state (which
was at least the case in England), no one who saw their mutual
jealousy, rising on one side to the highest exasperation, could
fail to anticipate that some great revolution must be at hand;
and that an union, neither federal nor legislative, but possessing
every inconvenience of both, could not long be endured. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
well known business of the Darien company must have undeceived
every rational man who dreamed of any alternative
but incorporation or separation. The Scots parliament took
care to bring on the crisis by the act of security in 1704. It
was enacted that, on the queen's death without issue, the estates
should meet to name a successor of the royal line, and a
protestant; but that this should not be the same person who
would succeed to the crown of England, unless during her
majesty's reign conditions should be established to secure from
English influence the honour and independence of the kingdom,
the authority of parliament, the religion, trade, and liberty of
the nation. This was explained to mean a free intercourse with
the plantations, and the benefits of the navigation act. The
prerogative of declaring peace and war was to be subjected for
ever to the approbation of parliament, lest at any future time
these conditions should be revoked.</p>

<p><i>Act of security.</i>&mdash;Those who obtained the act of security were
partly of the jacobite faction, who saw in it the hope of restoring
at least Scotland to the banished heir; partly of a very different
description, whigs in principle, and determined enemies of the
Pretender, but attached to their country, jealous of the English
court, and determined to settle a legislative union on such terms
as became an independent state. Such an union was now seen
in England to be indispensable; the treaty was soon afterwards
begun, and, after a long discussion of the terms between the
commissioners of both kingdoms, the incorporation took effect
on the 1st of May 1707. It is provided by the articles of this
treaty, confirmed by the parliaments, that the succession of
the united kingdom shall remain to the Princess Sophia, and
the heirs of her body, being protestants; that all privileges of
trade shall belong equally to both nations; that there shall be
one great seal, and the same coin, weights, and measures; that
the episcopal and presbyterian churches of England and Scotland
shall be for ever established, as essential and fundamental
parts of the union; that the united kingdom shall be represented
by one and the same parliament, to be called the parliament of
Great Britain; that the number of peers for Scotland shall be
sixteen, to be elected for every parliament by the whole body,
and the number of representatives of the Commons forty-five,
two-thirds of whom to be chosen by the counties, and one-third
by the boroughs; that the Crown be restrained from creating
any new peers of Scotland; that both parts of the united kingdom
shall be subject to the same duties of excise, and the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
customs on export and import; but that, when England raises
two millions by a land-tax, £48,000 shall be raised in Scotland,
and in like proportion.</p>

<p>It has not been unusual for Scotsmen, even in modern times,
while they cannot but acknowledge the expediency of an union,
and the blessings which they have reaped from it, to speak of
its conditions as less favourable than their ancestors ought to
have claimed. For this however there does not seem much
reason. The ratio of population would indeed have given
Scotland about one-eighth of the legislative body, instead of
something less than one-twelfth; but no government except
the merest democracy is settled on the sole basis of numbers;
and if the comparison of wealth and of public contributions was
to be admitted, it may be thought that a country, which stipulated
for itself to pay less than one-fortieth of direct taxation,
was not entitled to a much greater share of the representation
than it obtained. Combining the two ratios of population
and property, there seems little objection to this part of the
union; and in general it may be observed of the articles of
that treaty, what often occurs with compacts intended to oblige
future ages, that they have rather tended to throw obstacles
in the way of reformations for the substantial benefit of Scotland,
than to protect her against encroachment and usurpation.</p>

<p>This however could not be securely anticipated in the reign
of Anne; and, no doubt, the measure was an experiment of
such hazard that every lover of his country must have consented
in trembling, or revolted from it with disgust. No past experience
of history was favourable to the absorption of a lesser state
(at least where the government partook so much of the republican
form) in one of superior power and ancient rivalry. The
representation of Scotland in the united legislature was too
feeble to give anything like security against the English prejudices
and animosities, if they should continue or revive. The
church was exposed to the most apparent perils, brought thus
within the power of a legislature so frequently influenced by
one which held her not as a sister, but rather a bastard usurper
of a sister's inheritance; and, though her permanence was
guaranteed by the treaty, yet it was hard to say how far the
legal competence of parliament might hereafter be deemed to
extend, or at least how far she might be abridged of her privileges,
and impaired in her dignity.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
 If very few of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
mischiefs have resulted from the union, it has doubtless been
owing to the prudence of our government, and chiefly to the
general sense of right, and the diminution both of national and
religious bigotry during the last century. But it is always to
be kept in mind, as the best justification of those who came
into so great a sacrifice of natural patriotism, that they gave
up no excellent form of polity, that the Scots constitution had
never produced the people's happiness, that their parliament
was bad in its composition, and in practice little else than a
factious and venal aristocracy; that they had before them the
alternatives of their present condition, with the prospect of
unceasing discontent, half suppressed by unceasing corruption,
or of a more honourable, but very precarious, separation of the
two kingdoms, the renewal of national wars and border-feuds,
at a cost the poorer of the two could never endure, and at a
hazard of ultimate conquest, which, with all her pride and
bravery, the experience of the last generation had shown to be
no impossible term of the contest.</p>

<p>The union closes the story of the Scots constitution. From
its own nature, not more than from the gross prostitution with
which a majority had sold themselves to the surrender of their
own legislative existence, it was long odious to both parties in
Scotland. An attempt to dissolve it by the authority of the
united parliament itself was made in a very few years, and not
very decently supported by the whigs against the queen's last
ministry. But, after the accession of the house of Hanover, the
jacobite party displayed such strength in Scotland, that to
maintain the union was evidently indispensable for the reigning
family. That party comprised a large proportion of the superior
classes, and nearly the whole of the episcopal church, which,
though fallen, was for some years considerable in numbers.
The national prejudices ran in favour of their ancient stock of
kings, conspiring with the sentiment of dishonour attached to
the union itself, and jealousy of some innovations which a
legislature they were unwilling to recognise thought fit to introduce.
It is certain that jacobitism, in England little more,
after the reign of George I., than an empty word, the vehicle
of indefinite dissatisfaction in those who were never ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
encounter peril or sacrifice advantage for its affected principle,
subsisted in Scotland as a vivid emotion of loyalty, a generous
promptitude to act or suffer in its cause; and, even when all
hope was extinct, clung to the recollections of the past, long
after the very name was only known by tradition, and every
feeling connected with it had been wholly effaced to the south
of the Tweed. It is believed that some persons in that country
kept up an intercourse with Charles Edward as their sovereign
till his decease in 1787. They had given, forty years before,
abundant testimonies of their activity to serve him. That
rebellion is, in more respects than one, disgraceful to the British
government; but it furnished an opportunity for a wise measure
to prevent its recurrence, and to break down in some degree
the aristocratical ascendancy, by abolishing the hereditary
jurisdictions which, according to the genius of the feudal system,
were exercised by territorial proprietors under royal charter or
prescription. Much however still remains to be done, in order
to place that now wealthy and well-instructed people on a
footing with the English, as to the just participation of political
liberty; but what would best conform to the spirit of the act
of union might possibly sometimes contravene its letter.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="s08">ON THE CONSTITUTION OF IRELAND</span></h2>

<p><i>Ancient state of Ireland.</i>&mdash;The antiquities of Irish history,
imperfectly recorded, and rendered more obscure by controversy,
seem hardly to belong to our present subject. But
the political order or state of society among that people at
the period of Henry II.'s invasion must be distinctly apprehended
and kept in mind, before we can pass a judgment
upon, or even understand, the course of succeeding events,
and the policy of the English government in relation to that
island.</p>

<p>It can hardly be necessary to mention (the idle traditions of
a derivation from Spain having long been exploded) that the
Irish are descended from one of those Celtic tribes which occupied
Gaul and Britain some centuries before the Christian era.
Their language however is so far dissimilar from that spoken
in Wales, though evidently of the same root, as to render it
probable that the emigration, whether from this island or from
Armorica, was in a remote age; while its close resemblance to
that of the Scottish Highlanders, which hardly can be called
another dialect, as unequivocally demonstrates a nearer affinity
of the two nations. It seems to be generally believed, though
the antiquaries are far from unanimous, that the Irish are the
parent tribe, and planted their colony in Scotland since the
commencement of our era.</p>

<p>About the end of the eighth century, some of those swarms
of Scandinavian descent which were poured out in such unceasing
and irresistible multitudes on France and Britain, began
to settle on the coasts of Ireland. These colonists were known
by the name of Ostmen, or men from the east, as in France they
were called Normans from their northern origin. They occupied
the sea-coast from Antrim easterly round to Limerick; and by
them the principal cities of Ireland were built. They waged war
for some time against the aboriginal Irish in the interior; but,
though better acquainted with the arts of civilised life, their
inferiority in numbers caused them to fail at length in this
contention; and the practical invasions from their brethren in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Norway becoming less frequent in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, they had fallen into a state of dependence on the
native princes.</p>

<p>The island was divided into five provincial kingdoms, Leinster,
Munster, Ulster, Connaught, and Meath; one of whose sovereigns
was chosen king of Ireland in some general meeting, probably of
the nobility or smaller chieftains, and of the prelates. But there
seems to be no clear tradition as to the character of this national
assembly, though some maintain it to have been triennially held.
The monarch of the island had tributes from the inferior kings,
and a certain supremacy, especially in the defence of the country
against invasion; but the constitution was of a federal nature,
and each was independent in ruling his people, or in making
war on his neighbours. Below the kings were the chieftains of
different septs or families, perhaps in one or two degrees of
subordination, bearing a relation, which may be loosely called
feudal, to each other, and to the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
</p>

<p>These chieftainships, and perhaps even the kingdoms themselves,
though not partible, followed a very different rule of
succession than that of primogeniture. They were subject to
the law of tanistry, of which the principle is defined to be, that
the demesne lands and dignity of chieftainship descended to the
eldest and most worthy of the same blood; these epithets not
being used, we may suppose, synonymously, but in order to
indicate that the preference given to seniority was to be controlled
by a due regard to desert. No better mode, it is evident,
of providing for a perpetual supply of those civil quarrels, in
which the Irish are supposed to place so much of their enjoyment,
could have been devised. Yet, as these grew sometimes
a little too frequent, it was not unusual to elect a tanist, or
reversionary successor, in the lifetime of the reigning chief, as
has been the practice of more civilised nations. An infant was
never allowed to hold the sceptre of an Irish kingdom, but was
necessarily postponed to his uncle or other kinsman of mature
age; as was the case also in England, even after the consolidation
of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>The land-owners, who did not belong to the noble class, bore
the same name as their chieftain, and were presumed to be of the
same lineage. But they held their estates by a very different
and an extraordinary tenure, that of Irish gavel-kind. On the
decease of a proprietor, instead of an equal partition among his
children, as in the gavel-kind of English law, the chief of the
sept, according to the generally received explanation, made, or
was entitled to make, a fresh division of all the lands within his
district; allotting to the heirs of the deceased a portion of the
integral territory along with the other members of the tribe. It
seems impossible to conceive that these partitions were renewed
on every death of one of the sept. But they are asserted to have
at least taken place so frequently as to produce a continual
change of possession. The policy of this custom doubtless
sprung from too jealous a solicitude as to the excessive inequality
of wealth, and from the habit of looking on the tribe
as one family of occupants, not wholly divested of its original
right by the necessary allotment of lands to particular cultivators.
It bore some degree of analogy to the institution of the year of
Jubilee in the Mosaic code, and what may be thought more
immediate, was almost exactly similar to the rule of succession
which is laid down in the ancient laws of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Rude state of society.</i>&mdash;In the territories of each sept, judges
called Brehons, and taken out of certain families, sat with
primeval simplicity upon turfen benches in some conspicuous
situation, to determine controversies. Their usages are almost
wholly unknown; for what have been published as fragments of
the Brehon law seem open to great suspicion at least of being
interpolated.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
 It is notorious that, according to the custom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
many states in the infancy of civilisation, the Irish admitted
the composition or fine for murder, instead of capital punishment;
and this was divided, as in other countries, between the
kindred of the slain and the judge.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century it is evident that the Irish nation had
made far less progress in the road of improvement than any other
of Europe in circumstance of climate and position so little unfavourable.
They had no arts that deserve the name, nor any
commerce, their best line of sea-coast being occupied by the
Norwegians. They had no fortified towns, nor any houses or
castles of stone; the first having been erected at Tuam a very
few years before the invasion of Henry.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
 Their conversion to
Christianity indeed, and the multitude of cathedral and conventual
churches erected throughout the island, had been the
cause, and probably the sole cause, of the rise of some cities, or
villages with that name, such as Armagh, Cashel, and Trim.
But neither the chiefs nor the people loved to be confined within
their precincts, and chose rather to dwell in scattered cabins
amidst the free solitude of bogs and mountains. As we might
expect, their qualities were such as belong to man by his original
nature, and which he displays in all parts of the globe where the
state of society is inartificial: they were gay, generous, hospitable,
ardent in attachment and hate, credulous of falsehood, prone to
anger and violence, generally crafty and cruel. With these very
general attributes of a barbarous people, the Irish character was
distinguished by a peculiar vivacity of imagination, an enthusiasm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
and impetuosity of passion, and a more than ordinary bias
towards a submissive and superstitious spirit in religion.</p>

<p>This spirit may justly be traced in a great measure to the
virtues and piety of the early preachers of the gospel in that
country. Their influence, though at this remote age, and with
our imperfect knowledge, it may hardly be distinguishable
amidst the licentiousness and ferocity of a rude people, was
necessarily directed to counteract those vices, and cannot have
failed to mitigate and compensate their evil. In the seventh
and eighth centuries, while a total ignorance seemed to overspread
the face of Europe, the monasteries and schools of Ireland
preserved, in the best manner they could, such learning as had
survived the revolutions of the Roman world. But the learning
of monasteries had never much efficacy in dispelling the ignorance
of the laity; and indeed, even in them, it had decayed long before
the twelfth century. The clergy were respected and numerous,
the bishops alone amounting at one time to no less than 300;<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>

and it has been maintained by our most learned writers, that
they were wholly independent of the see of Rome till, a little
before the English invasion, one of their primates thought fit
to solicit the pall from thence on his consecration, according to
the discipline long practised in other western churches.</p>

<p>It will be readily perceived that the government of Ireland
must have been almost entirely aristocratical, and not very unlike
that of the feudal confederacies in France during the ninth
and tenth centuries. It was perhaps still more oppressive. The
ancient condition of the common people of Ireland, says Sir
James Ware, was very little different from slavery.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
 Unless we
believe this condition to have been greatly deteriorated under
the rule of their native chieftains after the English settlement,
for which there seems no good reason, we must give little credit
to the fanciful pictures of prosperity and happiness in that period
of aboriginal independence, which the Irish, in their discontent
with later times, have been apt to draw. They had, no doubt,
like all other nations, good and wise princes, as well as tyrants
and usurpers. But we find by their annals that, out of two
hundred ancient kings, of whom some brief memorials are
recorded, not more than thirty came to a natural death;<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
 while,
for the later period, the oppression of the Irish chieftains, and
of those degenerate English who trod in their steps, and emulated
the vices they should have restrained, is the one constant theme
of history. Their exactions kept the peasants in hopeless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
poverty, their tyranny in perpetual fear. The chief claimed
a right of taking from his tenants provisions for his own use at
discretion, or of sojourning in their houses. This was called
coshery, and is somewhat analogous to the royal prerogative of
purveyance. A still more terrible oppression was the quartering
of the lords' soldiers on the people, sometimes mitigated by a
composition, called by the Irish bonaght.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
 For the perpetual
warfare of these petty chieftains had given rise to the employment
of mercenary troops, partly natives, partly from Scotland,
known by the uncouth names of Kerns and Gallowglasses, who
proved the scourge of Ireland down to its final subjugation by
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>This unusually backward condition of society furnished but
an inauspicious presage for the future. Yet we may be led by
the analogy of other countries to think it probable that, if
Ireland had not tempted the cupidity of her neighbours, there
would have arisen in the course of time some Egbert or Harold
Harfager to consolidate the provincial kingdoms into one
hereditary monarchy; which, by the adoption of better laws, the
increase of commerce, and a frequent intercourse with the chief
courts of Europe, might have taken as respectable a station as
that of Scotland in the commonwealth of Christendom. If the
two islands had afterwards become incorporated through intermarriage
of their sovereigns, as would very likely have taken
place, it might have been on such conditions of equality as
Ireland, till lately, has never known; and certainly without that
long tragedy of crime and misfortune which her annals unfold.</p>

<p><i>Invasion of Henry II.</i>&mdash;The reduction of Ireland, at least in
name, under the dominion of Henry II. was not achieved by
his own efforts. He had little share in it beyond receiving the
homage of Irish princes, and granting charters to his English
nobility. Strongbow, Lacy, Fitz-Stephen, were the real conquerors,
through whom alone any portion of Irish territory
was gained by arms or treaty; and, as they began the enterprise
without the king, they carried it on also for themselves,
deeming their swords a better security than his charters. This
ought to be kept in mind, as revealing the secret of the English
government over Ireland, and furnishing a justification for what
has the appearance of a negligent abandonment of its authority.
The few barons, and other adventurers, who, by dint of forces
hired by themselves, and, in some instances, by conventions
with the Irish, settled their armed colonies in the island, thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
they had done much for Henry II. in causing his name to be
acknowledged, his administration to be established in Dublin,
and in holding their lands by his grant. They claimed in their
turn, according to the practice of all nations and the principles
of equity, that those who had borne the heat of the battle,
should enjoy the spoil without molestation. Hence, the enormous
grants of Henry and his successors, though so often
censured for impolicy, were probably what they could scarce
avoid; and, though not perhaps absolutely stipulated as the
price of titular sovereignty, were something very like it.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
 But
what is to be censured, and what at all hazards they were bound
to refuse, was the violation of their faith to the Irish princes,
in sharing among these insatiable barons their ancient territories;
which, setting aside the wrong of the first invasion,
were protected by their homage and submission, and sometimes
by positive conventions. The whole island, in fact, with the
exception of the county of Dublin and the maritime towns, was
divided, before the end of the thirteenth century, and most of
it in the twelfth, among ten English families: Earl Strongbow,
who had some colour of hereditary title, according to our notions
of law, by his marriage with the daughter of Dermot, king of
Leinster, obtaining a grant of that province; Lacy acquiring
Meath, which was not reckoned a part of Leinster, in the same
manner; the whole of Ulster being given to De Courcy; the whole
of Connaught to De Burgh; and the rest to six others. These, it
must be understood, they were to hold in a sort of feudal suzerainty,
parcelling them among their tenants of English race, and
expelling the natives, or driving them into the worst parts of
the country by an incessant warfare.</p>

<p><i>Forms of English constitution established.</i>&mdash;The Irish chieftains,
though compelled to show some exterior signs of submission to
Henry, never thought of renouncing their own authority or the
customs of their forefathers; nor did he pretend to interfere
with the government of their septs, content with their promise
of homage and tribute, neither of which were afterwards paid.
But in those parts of Ireland which he reckoned his own, it
was his aim to establish the English laws, to render the lesser
island, as it were, a counterpart in all its civil constitution, and
mirror of the greater. The colony from England was already
not inconsiderable, and likely to increase; the Ostmen, who
inhabited the maritime towns, came very willingly, as all settlers
of Teutonic origin have done, into the English customs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
language; and upon this basis, leaving the accession of the
aboriginal people to future contingencies, he raised the edifice
of the Irish constitution. He gave charters of privilege to the
chief towns, began a division into counties, appointed sheriffs
and judges of assize to administer justice, erected supreme
courts at Dublin, and perhaps assembled parliaments.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
 His
successors pursued the same course of policy; the great charter
of liberties, as soon as granted by John at Runnymede, was sent
over to Ireland; and the whole common law, with all its forms
of process, and every privilege it was deemed to convey, became
the birthright of the Anglo-Irish colonists.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
</p>

<p>These had now spread over a considerable part of the island.
Twelve counties appear to have been established by John, comprehending
most of Leinster and Munster; while the two
ambitious families of Courcy and De Burgh encroached more
and more on the natives in the other provinces.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
 But the same
necessity, which gratitude for the services, or sense of the power
of the great families had engendered, for rewarding them by
excessive grants of territory, led to other concessions that
rendered them almost independent of the monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
 The
franchise of a county palatine gave a right of exclusive civil
and criminal jurisdiction; so that the king's writ should not
run, nor his judges come within it, though judgment in its
courts might be reversed by writ of error in the king's bench.
The lord might enfeoff tenants to hold by knight's service of
himself; he had almost all regalian rights; the lands of those
attainted for treason escheated to him; he acted in everything
rather as one of the great feudatories of France or Germany
than a subject of the English Crown. Such had been Chester,
and only Chester, in England; but in Ireland this dangerous
independence was permitted to Strongbow in Leinster, to Lacy
in Meath, and at a later time to the Butlers and Geraldines in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
parts of Munster. Strongbow's vast inheritance soon fell to
five sisters, who took to their shares, with the same palatine
rights, the counties of Carlow, Wexford, Kilkenny, Kildare, and
the district of Leix, since called the Queen's County.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
 In all
these palatinates, forming by far the greater portion of the
English territories, the king's process had its course only within
the lands belonging to the church.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
 The English aristocracy
of Ireland, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, bears a
much closer analogy to that of France in rather an earlier period
than anything which the history of this island can show.</p>

<p>Pressed by the inroads of these barons, and despoiled frequently
of lands secured to them by grant or treaty, the native
chiefs had recourse to the throne for protection, and would in
all likelihood have submitted without repining to a sovereign
who could have afforded it.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
 But John and Henry III., in
whose reigns the independence of the aristocracy was almost
complete, though insisting by writs and proclamations on a due
observance of the laws, could do little more for their new subjects,
who found a better chance of redress in standing on their
own defence. The powerful septs of the north enjoyed their
liberty. But those of Munster and Leinster, intermixed with
the English, and encroached upon from every side, were the
victims of constant injustice; and abandoning the open country
for bog and mountain pasture, grew more poor and barbarous
in the midst of the general advance of Europe. Many remained
under the yoke of English lords, and in a worse state than that
of villenage, because still less protected by the tribunals of
justice. The Irish had originally stipulated with Henry II. for
the use of their own laws.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
 They were consequently held beyond
the pale of English justice, and regarded as aliens at the best,
sometimes as enemies, in our courts. Thus, as by the Brehon
customs murder was only punished by a fine, it was not held
felony to kill one of Irish race, unless he had conformed to the
English law.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
 Five septs, to which the royal families of Ireland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
belonged, the names of O'Neal, O'Connor, O'Brien, O'Malachlin,
and MacMurrough, had the special immunity of being within
the protection of our law, and it was felony to kill one of them.
I do not know by what means they obtained this privilege; for
some of these were certainly as far from the king's obedience
as any in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
 But besides these a vast number of charters
of denization were granted to particular persons of Irish descent
from the reign of Henry II. downwards, which gave them and
their posterity the full birthrights of English subjects; nor
does there seem to have been any difficulty in procuring these.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>

It cannot be said, therefore, that the English government, or
those who represented it in Dublin, displayed any reluctance
to emancipate the Irish from thraldom. Whatever obstruction
might be interposed to this was from that assembly whose concurrence
was necessary to every general measure, the Anglo-Irish
parliament. Thus, in 1278, we find the first instance of
an application from the community of Ireland, as it is termed,
but probably from some small number of septs dwelling among
the colony, that they might be admitted to live by the English
law, and offering 8000 marks for this favour. The letter of
Edward I. to the justiciary of Ireland on this is sufficiently
characteristic both of his wisdom and his rapaciousness. He is
satisfied of the expediency of granting the request, provided it
can be done with the general consent of the prelates and nobles
of Ireland; and directs the justiciary, if he can obtain that
concurrence, to agree with the petitioners for the highest fine
he can obtain, and for a body of good and stout soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
 But
this necessary consent of the aristocracy was withheld. Excuses
were made to evade the king's desire. It was wholly incompatible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
with their systematic encroachments on their Irish
neighbours to give them the safeguard of the king's writ for
their possessions. The Irish renewed their supplication more
than once, both to Edward I. and Edward III.; they found
the same readiness in the English court; they sunk at home
through the same unconquerable oligarchy.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
 It is not to be
imagined that the entire Irishry partook in this desire of renouncing
their ancient customs. Besides the prejudices of
nationality, there was a strong inducement to preserve the
Brehon laws of tanistry, which suited better a warlike tribe
than the hereditary succession of England. But it was the
unequivocal duty of the legislature to avail itself of every token
of voluntary submission; which, though beginning only with
the subject septs of Leinster, would gradually incorporate the
whole nation in a common bond of co-equal privileges with
their conquerors.</p>

<p><i>Degeneracy of English settlers.</i>&mdash;Meanwhile, these conquerors
were themselves brought under a moral captivity of the most
disgraceful nature; and, not as the rough soldier of Rome is
said to have been subdued by the art and learning of Greece,
the Anglo-Norman barons, that had wrested Ireland from the
native possessors, fell into their barbarous usages, and emulated
the vices of the vanquished. This degeneracy of the English
settlers began very soon, and continued to increase for several
ages. They intermarried with the Irish; then connected themselves
with them by the national custom of fostering, which
formed an artificial relationship of the strictest nature;<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
 they
spoke the Irish language; they affected the Irish dress and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
manner of wearing the hair;<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
 they even adopted, in some
instances, Irish surnames; they harassed their tenants with
every Irish exaction and tyranny; they administered Irish law,
if any at all; they became chieftains rather than peers; and
neither regarded the king's summons to his parliaments, nor
paid any obedience to his judges.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
 Thus the great family of
De Burgh or Burke, in Connaught, fell off almost entirely from
subjection; nor was that of the Earls of Desmond, a younger
branch of the house of Geraldine or Fitzgerald, much less independent
of the Crown; though by the title it enjoyed, and
the palatine franchises granted to it by Edward III. over the
counties of Limerick and Kerry, it seemed to keep up more show
of English allegiance.</p>

<p>The regular constitution of Ireland was, as I have said, as
nearly as possible a counterpart of that established in this
country. The administration was vested in an English justiciary
or lord deputy, assisted by a council of judges and principal
officers, mixed with some prelates and barons, but subordinate
to that of England, wherein sat the immediate advisers of
the sovereign. The courts of chancery, king's bench, common
pleas, and exchequer, were the same in both countries; but
writs of error lay from judgments given in the second of these
to the same court in England. For all momentous purposes,
as to grant a subsidy, or enact a statute, it was as necessary to
summon a parliament in the one island as in the other. An
Irish parliament originally, like an English one, was but a more
numerous council, to which the more distant as well as the neighbouring
barons were summoned, whose consent, though dispensed
with in ordinary acts of state, was both the pledge and
the condition of their obedience to legislative provisions. In
1295, the sheriff of each county and liberty is directed to return
two knights to a parliament held by Wogan, an active and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
able deputy.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
 The date of the admission of burgesses cannot be
fixed with precision; but it was probably not earlier than the
reign of Edward III. They appear in 1341; and the Earl of
Desmond summoned many deputies from corporations to his
rebel convention held at Kilkenny in the next year.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
 The
Commons are mentioned as an essential part of parliament in
an ordinance of 1359; before which time, in the opinion of Lord
Coke, "the conventions in Ireland were not so much parliaments
as assemblies of great men."<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
 This, as appears, is not
strictly correct; but in substance they were perhaps little else
long afterwards.</p>

<p>The earliest statutes on record are of the year 1310; and from
that year they are lost till 1429, though we know many parliaments
to have been held in the meantime, and are acquainted
by other means with their provisions. Those of 1310 bear
witness to the degeneracy of the English lords, and to the laudable
zeal of a feeble government for the reformation of their
abuses. They begin with an act to restrain great lords from
taking of prises, lodging, and sojourning with the people of the
country against their will. "It is agreed and assented," the
act proceeds, "that no such prises shall be henceforth made
without ready payment and agreement, and that none shall
harbour or sojourn at the house of any other by such malice
against the consent of him which is owner of the house to
destroy his goods; and, if any shall do the same, such prises,
and such manner of destruction, shall be holden for open
robbery, and the king shall have the suit thereof, if others will
not, nor dare not sue. It is agreed also, that none shall keep
idle people nor kearn (foot-soldiers) in time of peace to live
upon the poor of the country, but that those which will have
them, shall keep them at their own charges, so that their free
tenants, nor farmers, nor other tenants, be not charged with
them." The statute proceeds to restrain great lords or others,
except such as have royal franchises, from giving protections,
which they used to compel the people to purchase; and directs
that there shall be commissions of assize and gaol delivery
through all the counties of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
</p>

<p>These regulations exhibit a picture of Irish miseries. The
barbarous practices of coshering and bonaght, the latter of
which was generally known in later times by the name of coyne
and livery, had been borrowed from those native chieftains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
whom our modern Hibernians sometimes hold forth as the
paternal benefactors of their country.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
 It was the crime of the
Geraldines and the De Courcys to have retrograded from the
comparative humanity and justice of England, not to have
deprived the people of freedom and happiness they had never
known. These degenerate English, an epithet by which they
are always distinguished, paid no regard to the statutes of a
parliament which they had disdained to attend, and which
could not render itself feared. We find many similar laws in
the fifteenth century, after the interval which I have noticed
in the printed records. And, in the intervening period, a parliament
held by Lionel Duke of Clarence, second son of Edward
III., at Kilkenny, in 1367, the most numerous assembly that
had ever met in Ireland, was prevailed upon to pass a very severe
statute against the insubordinate and degenerate colonists. It
recites that the English of the realm of Ireland were become
mere Irish in their language, names, apparel, and manner of
living, that they had rejected the English laws, and allied themselves
by intermarriage with the Irish. It prohibits, under the
penalties of high treason, or at least of forfeiture of lands, all
these approximations to the native inhabitants, as well as the
connections of fostering and gossipred. The English are restrained
from permitting the Irish to grace their lands, from
presenting them to benefices, or receiving them into religious
houses, and from entertaining their bards. On the other hand,
they are forbidden to make war upon their Irish neighbours
without the authority of the state. And, to enforce better
these provisions, the king's sheriffs are empowered to enter all
franchises for the apprehension of felons or traitors.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Disorderly state of the island.</i>&mdash;This statute, like all others
passed in Ireland, so far from pretending to bind the Irish,
regarded them not only as out of the king's allegiance, but as
perpetually hostile to his government. They were generally
denominated the Irish enemy. This doubtless was not according
to the policy of Henry II., nor of the English government
a considerable time after his reign. Nor can it be said to be
the fact, though from some confusion of times the assertion is
often made, that the island was not subject, in a general sense,
to that prince and to the three next kings of England. The
English were settled in every province; an imperfect division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of counties and administration of justice subsisted; and even
the Irish chieftains, though ruling their septs by the Brehon
law, do not appear in that period to have refused the acknowledgment
of the king's sovereignty. But compelled to defend
their lands against perpetual aggression, they justly renounced
all allegiance to a government which could not redeem the
original wrong of its usurpation by the benefits of protection.
They became gradually stronger; they regained part of their
lost territories; and after the era of 1315, when Edward Bruce
invaded the kingdom with a Scots army, and, though ultimately
defeated, threw the government into a disorder from which it
never recovered, their progress was so rapid, that in the space
of thirty or forty years, the northern provinces, and even part
of the southern, were entirely lost to the Crown of England.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
</p>

<p>It is unnecessary in so brief a sketch to follow the unprofitable
annals of Ireland in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Amidst the usual variations of war, the English interests were
continually losing ground. Once only Richard II. appeared
with a very powerful army, and the princes of Ireland crowded
round his throne to offer homage.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
 But, upon his leaving the
kingdom, they returned of course to their former independence
and hostility. The long civil wars of England in the next
century consummated the ruin of its power over the sister
island. The Irish possessed all Ulster, and shared Connaught
with the degenerate Burkes. The sept of O'Brien held their own
district of Thomond, now the county of Clare. A considerable
part of Leinster was occupied by other independent tribes;
while, in the south, the Earls of Desmond, lords either by
property or territorial jurisdiction of the counties of Kerry and
Limerick, and in some measure of those of Cork and Waterford,
united the turbulence of English barons with the savage manners
of Irish chieftains; ready to assume either character as best
suited their rapacity and ambition; reckless of the king's laws
or his commands, but not venturing, nor upon the whole,
probably wishing, to cast off the name of his subjects. The
elder branch of their house, the Earls of Kildare, and another
illustrious family, the Butlers, Earls of Ormond, were apparently
more steady in their obedience to the Crown; yet, in the great
franchises of the latter, comprising the counties of Kilkenny
and Tipperary, the king's writ had no course; nor did he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
exercise any civil or military authority but by the permission of
this mighty peer.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
</p>

<p><i>English Law confined to the pale.</i>&mdash;Thus, in the reign of Henry
VII., when the English authority over Ireland had reached its
lowest point, it was, with the exception of a very few sea-ports,
to all intents confined to the four counties of the English pale,
a name not older perhaps than the preceding century; those of
Dublin, Louth, Kildare, and Meath, the latter of which at that
time included West Meath. But even in these there were
extensive marches, or frontier districts, the inhabitants of which
were hardly distinguishable from the Irish, and paid them a
tribute, called black-rent; so that the real supremacy of the
English laws was not probably established beyond the two first
of these counties, from Dublin to Dundalk on the coast, and for
about thirty miles inland.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
 From this time, however, we are
to date its gradual recovery. The more steady councils and
firmer prerogative of the Tudor kings left little chance of escape
from their authority either for rebellious peers of English race,
or the barbarous chieftains of Ireland.</p>

<p>I must pause at this place to observe that we shall hardly
find in the foregoing sketch of Irish history, during the period of
the Plantagenet dynasty (nor am I conscious of having concealed
any thing essential), that systematic oppression and misrule
which is every day imputed to the English nation and its government.
The policy of our kings appears to have generally been
wise and beneficent; but it is duly to be remembered that those
very limitations of their prerogative which constitute liberty,
must occasionally obstruct the execution of the best purposes;
and that the co-ordinate powers of parliament, so justly our
boast, may readily become the screen of private tyranny and
inveterate abuse. This incapacity of doing good as well as harm
has produced, comparatively speaking, little mischief in Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Britain; where the aristocratical element of the constitution is
neither so predominant, nor so much in opposition to the general
interest, as it may be deemed to have been in Ireland. But
it is manifestly absurd to charge the Edwards and Henrys, or
those to whom their authority was delegated at Dublin, with
the crimes they vainly endeavoured to chastise, much more to
erect either the wild barbarians of the north, the O'Neals and
O'Connors, or the degenerate houses of Burke and Fitzgerald,
into patriot assertors of their country's welfare. The laws and
liberties of England were the best inheritance to which Ireland
could attain; the sovereignty of the English crown her only
shield against native or foreign tyranny. It was her calamity
that these advantages were long withheld; but the blame can
never fall upon the government of this island.</p>

<p>In the contest between the houses of York and Lancaster,
most of the English colony in Ireland had attached themselves
to the fortunes of the White Rose; they even espoused the two
pretenders who put in jeopardy the crown of Henry VII.; and
became, of course, obnoxious to his jealousy, though he was
politic enough to forgive in appearance their disaffection. But,
as Ireland had for a considerable time rather served the purposes
of rebellious invaders than of the English monarchy, it was
necessary to make her subjection, at least so far as the settlers
of the pale were concerned, more than a word. This produced
the famous statute of Drogheda in 1495, known by the name of
Poyning's law, from the lord deputy through whose vigour and
prudence it was enacted. It contains a variety of provisions
to restrain the lawlessness of the Anglo-Irish within the pale
(for to no others could it immediately extend), and to confirm
the royal sovereignty. All private hostilities without the
deputy's licence were declared illegal; but to excite the Irish
to war was made high treason. Murders were to be prosecuted
according to law, and not in the manner of the natives, by
pillaging, or exacting a fine from the sept of the slayer. The
citizens or freemen of towns were prohibited from receiving
wages or becoming retainers of lords and gentlemen; and, to
prevent the ascendency of the latter class, none who had not
served apprenticeships were to be admitted as aldermen or
freemen of corporations. The requisitions of coyne and livery,
which had subsisted in spite of the statutes of Kilkenny, were
again forbidden, and those statutes were renewed and confirmed.
The principal officers of state and the judges were to hold their
patents during pleasure, "because of the great inconveniences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
that had followed from their being for term of life, to the king's
grievous displeasure." A still more important provision, in its
permanent consequence, was made, by enacting that all statutes
lately made in England be deemed good and effectual in Ireland.
It has been remarked that the same had been done by an Irish
act of Edward IV. Some question might also be made, whether
the word "lately" was not intended to limit this acceptation
of English law. But in effect this enactment has made an epoch
in Irish jurisprudence; all statutes made in England prior to
the eighteenth year of Henry VII. being held equally valid in
Ireland, while none of later date have any operation, unless
specially adopted by its parliament; so that the law of the two
countries has begun to diverge from that time, and after three
centuries has been in several respects differently modified.</p>

<p>But even these articles of Poyning's law are less momentous
than one by which it is peculiarly known. It is enacted that no
parliament shall in future be holden in Ireland, till the king's
lieutenant shall certify to the king, under the great seal, the
causes and considerations, and all such acts as it seems to them
ought to be passed thereon, and such be affirmed by the king
and his council, and his licence to hold a parliament be obtained.
Any parliament holden contrary to this form and provision
should be deemed void. Thus, by securing the initiative power
to the English council, a bridle was placed in the mouths of every
Irish parliament. It is probable also that it was designed as a
check on the lord-deputies, sometimes powerful Irish nobles,
whom it was dangerous not to employ, but still more dangerous
to trust. Whatever might be its motives, it proved in course of
time the great means of preserving the subordination of an
island, which, from the similarity of constitution, and the high
spirit of its inhabitants, was constantly panting for an independence
which her more powerful neighbour neither desired nor
dared to concede.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Royal authority revives under Henry VIII.</i>&mdash;No subjects of the
Crown in Ireland enjoyed such influence at this time as the Earls
of Kildare; whose possessions lying chiefly within the pale,
they did not affect an ostensible independence, but generally
kept in their hands the chief authority of government, though
it was the policy of the English court, in its state of weakness, to
balance them in some measure by the rival family of Butler.
But the self-confidence with which this exaltation inspired the
chief of the former house laid him open to the vengeance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Henry VIII.; he affected, while lord-deputy, to be surrounded
by Irish lords, to assume their wild manners, and to intermarry
his daughters with their race. The counsellors of English birth
or origin dreaded this suspicious approximation to their hereditary
enemies; and Kildare, on their complaint, was compelled
to obey his sovereign's order by repairing to London. He was
committed to the Tower; on a premature report that he had
suffered death, his son, a young man to whom he had delegated
the administration, took up arms under the rash impulse of
resentment; the primate was murdered by his wild followers,
but the citizens of Dublin and the reinforcements sent from
England suppressed this hasty rebellion, and its leader was sent
a prisoner to London. Five of his uncles, some of them not
concerned in the treason, perished with him on the scaffold; his
father had been more fortunate in a natural death; one sole
surviving child of twelve years old, who escaped to Flanders,
became afterwards the stock from which the great family of the
Geraldines was restored.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
</p>

<p>The chieftains of Ireland were justly attentive to the stern
and systematic despotism which began to characterise the
English government, displayed, as it thus was, in the destruction
of an ancient and loyal house. But their intimidation
produced contrary effects; they became more ready to profess
allegiance and to put on the exterior badges of submission; but
more jealous of the Crown in their hearts, more resolute to
preserve their independence, and to withstand any change of
laws. Thus, in the latter years of Henry, after the northern
Irish had been beaten by an able deputy, Lord Leonard Grey,
and the lordship of Ireland, the title hitherto borne by the
successors of Henry II., had been raised by act of parliament
to the dignity of a kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
 the native chiefs came in and submitted;
the Earl of Desmond, almost as independent as any of
the natives, attended parliament, from which his ancestors had
for some ages claimed a dispensation; several peerages were
conferred, some of them on the old Irish families; fresh laws
were about the same time enacted to establish the English dress
and language, and to keep the colonists apart from Irish intercourse;<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>

and after a disuse of two hundred years, the authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
of government was nominally recognised throughout Munster
and Connaught.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
 Yet we find that these provinces were still
in nearly the same condition as before; the king's judges did
not administer justice in them, the old Brehon usages continued
to prevail even in the territories of the new peers, though their
primogenitary succession was evidently incompatible with Irish
tanistry. A rebellion of two septs in Leinster under Edward VI.
led to a more complete reduction of their districts, called Leix
and O'Fally, which in the next reign were made shireland, by
the names of King's and Queen's County.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
 But, at the accession
of Elizabeth, it was manifest that an arduous struggle would
ensue between law and liberty; the one too nearly allied to cool-blooded
oppression, the other to ferocious barbarism.</p>

<p>It may be presumed, as has been already said, from the
analogy of other countries, that Ireland, if left to herself, would
have settled in time under some one line of kings, and assumed,
like Scotland, much of the feudal character, the best transitional
state of a monarchy from rudeness and anarchy to civilisation.
And, if the right of female succession had been established, it
might possibly have been united to the English Crown on a
juster footing, and with far less of oppression or bloodshed than
actually took place. But it was too late to dream of what might
have been: in the middle of the sixteenth century Ireland could
have no reasonable prospect of independence; nor could that
independence have been any other than the most savage liberty,
perhaps another denomination of serviture. It was doubtless
for the interest of that people to seek the English constitution,
which, at least in theory, was entirely accorded to their country,
and to press with spontaneous homage round the throne of
Elizabeth. But this was not the interest of their ambitious
chieftains, whether of Irish or English descent, of a Slanes
O'Neil, an Earl of Tyrone, an Earl of Desmond. Their influence
was irresistible among a nation ardently sensible to the attachments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
of clanship, averse to innovation, and accustomed to
dread and hate a government that was chiefly known by its
severities. But the unhappy alienation of Ireland from its
allegiance in part of the queen's reign would probably not have
been so complete, or at least led to such permanent mischiefs,
if the ancient national animosities had not been exasperated by
the still more invincible prejudices of religion.</p>

<p><i>Resistance of Irish to act of supremacy.</i>&mdash;Henry VIII. had no
sooner prevailed on the Lords and Commons of England to renounce
their spiritual obedience to the Roman see, and to
acknowledge his own supremacy, than, as a natural consequence,
he proceeded to establish it in Ireland. In the former instance,
many of his subjects, and even his clergy, were secretly attached
to the principles of the reformation; as many others were
jealous of ecclesiastical wealth, or eager to possess it. But in
Ireland the reformers had made no progress; it had been among
the effects of the pernicious separation of the two races, that the
Irish priests had little intercourse with their bishops, who were
nominated by the king, so that their synods are commonly
recited to have been holden <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter Anglicos</span></i>; the bishops themselves
were sometimes intruded by violence, more often dispossessed
by it; a total ignorance and neglect prevailed in the
church; and it is even found impossible to recover the succession
of names in some sees.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
 In a nation so ill predisposed, it was
difficult to bring about a compliance with the king's demand of
abjuring their religion; ignorant, but not indifferent, the clergy,
with Cromer the primate at their head, and most of the Lords
and Commons, in a parliament held at Dublin in 1536, resisted
the act of supremacy; which was nevertheless ultimately carried
by the force of government. Its enemies continued to withstand
the new schemes of reformation, more especially in the
next reign, when they went altogether to subvert the ancient
faith. As it appeared dangerous to summon a parliament, the
English liturgy was ordered by a royal proclamation; but
Dowdall, the new primate, as stubborn an adherent of the
Romish church as his predecessor, with most of the other
bishops and clergy, refused obedience; and the reformation was
never legally established in the short reign of Edward. His
eldest sister's accession reversed of course, what had been done,
and restored tranquillity in ecclesiastical matters; for the
protestants were too few to be worth persecution, nor were even
those molested who fled to Ireland from the fires of Smithfield.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p><i>Protestant church established by Elizabeth.</i>&mdash;Another scene of
revolution ensued in a very few years. Elizabeth having fixed
the protestant church on a stable basis in England, sent over the
Earl of Sussex to hold an Irish parliament in 1560. The disposition
of such an assembly might be presumed hostile to the
projected reformations; but, contrary to what had occurred on
this side of the channel, though the peers were almost uniformly
for the old religion, a large majority of the bishops are said to
have veered round with the times, and supported, at least by
conformity and acquiescence, the creed of the English court.
In the House of Commons, pains had been taken to secure a
majority; ten only out of twenty counties, which had at that
time been formed, received the writ of summons; and the
number of seventy-six representatives of the Anglo-Irish people
was made up by the towns, many of them under the influence
of the Crown, some perhaps containing a mixture of protestant
population. The English laws of supremacy and uniformity
were enacted in nearly the same words; and thus the common
prayer was at once set up instead of the mass, but with a singular
reservation, that in those parts of the country where the minister
had no knowledge of the English language, he might read the
service in Latin. All subjects were bound to attend the public
worship of the church, and every other was interdicted.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
</p>

<p>There were doubtless three arguments in favour of this compulsory
establishment of the protestant church, which must
have appeared so conclusive to Elizabeth and her council, that
no one in that age could have disputed them without incurring,
among other hazards, that of being accounted a lover of
unreasonable paradoxes. The first was, that the protestant
religion being true, it was the queen's duty to take care that her
subjects should follow no other; the second, that, being an
absolute monarch, or something like it, and a very wise princess,
she had a better right to order what doctrine they should believe,
than they could have to choose for themselves; the third, that
Ireland, being as a handmaid, and a conquered country, must
wait, in all important matters, on the pleasure of the greater
island, and be accommodated to its revolutions. And, as it was
natural that the queen and her advisers should not reject
maxims which all the rest of the world entertained, merely
because they were advantageous to themselves, we need not
perhaps be very acrimonious in censuring the laws whereon the
church of Ireland is founded. But it is still equally true that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
they involve a principle essentially unjust, and that they have
enormously aggravated, both in the age of Elizabeth and long
afterwards, the calamities and the disaffection of Ireland. An
ecclesiastical establishment, that is, the endowment and
privileges of a particular religious society, can have no advantages
(relatively at least to the community where it exists),
but its tendency to promote in that community good order and
virtue, religious knowledge and edification. But, to accomplish
this end in any satisfactory manner, it must be their church,
and not that merely of the government; it should exist for the
people, and in the people, and with the people. This indeed
is so manifest, that the government of Elizabeth never contemplated
the separation of a great majority as licensed dissidents
from the ordinances established for their instruction.
It was undoubtedly presumed, as it was in England, that the
church and commonwealth, according to Hooker's language,
were to be two denominations of the same society; and that
every man in Ireland who appertained to the one ought to
embrace, and in due season would embrace, the communion of
the other. There might be ignorance, there might be obstinacy,
there might be feebleness of conscience for a time; and perhaps
some connivance would be shown to these; but that the prejudices
of a majority should ultimately prevail so as to determine
the national faith, that it should even obtain a legitimate indulgence
for its own mode of worship, was abominable before
God, and incompatible with the sovereign authority.</p>

<p>This sort of reasoning, half bigotry, half despotism, was
nowhere so preposterously displayed as in Ireland. The numerical
majority is not always to be ascertained with certainty;
and some regard may fairly, or rather necessarily, be had to
rank, to knowledge, to concentration. But in that island, the
disciples of the reformation were in the most inconsiderable
proportion among the Anglo-Irish colony, as well as among the
natives; their church was a government without subjects, a
college of shepherds without sheep. I am persuaded that this
was not intended nor expected to be a permanent condition;
but such were the difficulties which the state of that unhappy
nation presented, or such the negligence of its rulers, that scarce
any pains were taken in the age of Elizabeth, nor indeed in
subsequent ages, to win the people's conviction or to eradicate
their superstitions, except by penal statutes and the sword.
The Irish language was universally spoken without the pale;
it had even made great progress within it; the clergy were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
principally of that nation; yet no translation of the scriptures,
the chief means through which the reformation had been effected
in England and Germany, nor even of the regular liturgy, was
made into that tongue; nor was it possible, perhaps, that any
popular instruction should be carried far in Elizabeth's reign,
either by public authority, or by the ministrations of the
reformed clergy. Yet neither among the Welsh nor the Scots
Highlanders, though Celtic tribes, and not much better in civility
of life at that time than the Irish, was the ancient religion
long able to withstand the sedulous preachers of reformation.</p>

<p>It is evident from the history of Elizabeth's reign, that the
forcible dispossession of the catholic clergy, and their consequent
activity in deluding a people too open at all times to
their counsels, aggravated the rebellious spirit of the Irish, and
rendered their obedience to the law more unattainable. But,
even independently of this motive, the Desmonds and Tyrones
would have tried, as they did, the chances of insurrection,
rather than abdicate their unlicensed but ancient chieftainship.
It must be admitted that, if they were faithless in promises of
loyalty, the Crown's representatives in Ireland set no good
example; and, when they saw the spoliations of property by
violence or pretext of law, the sudden executions on alleged
treasons, the breaches of treaty, sometimes even the assassinations,
by which a despotic policy went onward in its work of
subjugation, they did but play the usual game of barbarians in
opposing craft and perfidy, rather more gross perhaps and
notorious, to the same engines of a dissembling government.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Yet if we can put any trust in our own testimonies, the great
families were, by mismanagement and dissension, the curse of
their vassals. Sir Henry Sidney represents to the queen, in
1567, the wretched condition of the southern and western
counties in the vast territories of the Earls of Ormond, Desmond,
and Clanricarde.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
 "An unmeasurable tract," he says, "is now
waste and uninhabited, which of late years was well tilled and
pastured." "A more pleasant nor a more desolate land I
never saw than from Youghall to Limerick."<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
 "So far hath
that policy, or rather lack of policy, in keeping dissension among
them prevailed, as now, albeit all that are alive would become
honest and live in quiet, yet are there not left alive in those
two provinces the twentieth person necessary to inhabit the
same."<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
 Yet this was but the first scene of calamity. After
the rebellion of the last Earl of Desmond, the counties of Cork
and Kerry, his ample patrimony, were so wasted by war and
military executions, and famine and pestilence, that, according
to a contemporary writer, who expresses the truth with hyperbolical
energy, "the land itself, which before those wars was
populous, well inhabited, and rich in all the good blessings of
God, being plenteous of corn, full of cattle, well stored with
fruit and sundry other good commodities, is now become waste
and barren, yielding no fruits, the pastures no cattle, the fields
no corn, the air no birds, the seas, though full of fish, yet to them
yielding nothing. Finally, every way the curse of God was so
great, and the land so barren both of man and beast, that whosoever
did travel from the one end unto the other of all Munster,
even from Waterford to the head of Limerick, which is about
six-score miles, he should not meet any man, woman, or child,
saving in towns and cities; nor yet see any beast but the very
wolves, the foxes, and other like ravening beasts."<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
 The
severity of Sir Arthur Grey, at this time deputy, was such that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Elizabeth was assured he had left little for her to reign over but
ashes and carcasses; and, though not by any means of too
indulgent a nature, she was induced to recall him.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
 His successor,
Sir John Perrott, who held the viceroyalty only from
1584 to 1587, was distinguished for a sense of humanity and
justice, together with an active zeal for the enforcement of law.
Sheriffs were now appointed for the five counties into which
Connaught had some years before been parcelled; and even for
Ulster, all of which, except Antrim and Down, had hitherto
been undivided, as well as ungoverned.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
 Yet even this apparently
wholesome innovation aggravated at first the servitude
of the natives, whom the new sheriffs were prone to oppress.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>

Perrott, the best of Irish governors, soon fell a sacrifice to a
court intrigue and the queen's jealousy; and the remainder of
her reign was occupied with almost unceasing revolts of the
Earl of Tyrone, head of the great sept of O'Neil in Ulster, instigated
by Rome and Spain, and endangering, far more than any
preceding rebellion, her sovereignty over Ireland.</p>

<p>The old English of the pale were little more disposed to
embrace the reformed religion, or to acknowledge the despotic
principles of a Tudor administration, than the Irish themselves;
and though they did not join in the rebellions of those they so
much hated, the queen's deputies had sometimes to encounter
a more legal resistance. A new race of colonists had begun to
appear in their train, eager for possessions, and for the rewards
of the Crown, contemptuous of the natives, whether aboriginal
or of English descent, and in consequence the objects of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
aversion or jealousy.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
 Hence in a parliament summoned by
Sir Henry Sidney in 1569, the first after that which had reluctantly
established the protestant church, a strong country party,
as it may be termed, was formed in opposition to the Crown.
They complained with much justice of the management by
which irregular returns of members had been made; some from
towns not incorporated, and which had never possessed the
elective right; some self-chosen sheriffs and magistrates; some
mere English strangers, returned for places which they had
never seen. The judges, on reference to their opinion, declared
the elections illegal in the two former cases: but confirmed the
non-resident burgesses, which still left a majority for the court.</p>

<p>The Irish patriots, after this preliminary discussion, opposed
a new tax upon wines, and a bill for the suspension of Poyning's
law. Hooker, an Englishman, chosen for Athenry, to whose
account we are chiefly indebted for our knowledge of these proceedings,
sustained the former in that high tone of a prerogative
lawyer which always best pleased his mistress. "Her majesty,"
he said, "of her own royal authority, might and may establish
the same without any of your consents, as she hath already done
the like in England; saving of her courtesy, it pleaseth her to
have it pass with your own consents by order of law, that she
might thereby have the better trial and assurance of your
dutifulness and good-will towards her." This language from
a stranger, unusual among a people proud of their birthright in
the common constitution, and little accustomed even to legitimate
obedience, raised such a flame that the house was
adjourned; and it was necessary to protect the utterer of such
doctrines by a guard. The duty on wines, laid aside for the
time, was carried in a subsequent session in the same year; and
several other statutes were enacted, which, as they did not
affect the pale, may possibly have encountered no opposition.
A part of Ulster, forfeited by Slanes O'Neil, a rebel almost as
formidable in the first years of this reign as his kinsman Tyrone
was near its conclusion, was vested in the Crown; and some
provisions were made for the reduction of the whole island into
shires. Connaught, in consequence, which had passed for one
county, was divided into five.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
</p>

<p>In Sir Henry Sidney's second government, which began in
1576, the pale was excited to a more strenuous resistance, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
an attempt to subvert their liberties. It had long been usual
to obtain a sum of money for the maintenance of the household
and of the troops, by an assessment settled between the council
and principal inhabitants of each district. This, it was contended
by the government, was instead of the contribution of
victuals which the queen, by her prerogative of purveyance,
might claim at a fixed rate, much lower than the current price.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>

It was maintained on the other side to be a voluntary benevolence.
Sidney now devised a plan to change it for a cess or
permanent composition for every plough-land, without regard
to those which claimed exemption from the burthen of purveyance;
and imposed this new tax by order of council, as
sufficiently warrantable by the royal prerogative. The landowners
of the pale remonstrated against such a violation of
their franchises, and were met by the usual arguments. They
appealed to the text of the laws; the deputy replied by precedents
against law. "Her majesty's prerogative," he said,
"is not limited by Magna Charta, nor found in <i>Littleton's
Tenures</i>, nor written in the books of Assizes, but registered in
the remembrances of her majesty's exchequer, and remains in
the rolls of records of the Tower."<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
 It was proved, according
to him, by the most ancient and credible records in the realm,
that such charges had been imposed from time to time, sometimes
by the name of cess, sometimes by other names, and more
often by the governor and council, with such of the nobility as
came on summons, than by parliament. These irregularities
did not satisfy the gentry of the pale, who refused compliance
with the demand, and still alleged that it was contrary both to
reason and law to impose any charge upon them without parliament
or grand council. A deputation was sent to England in
the name of all the subjects of the English pale. Sidney was
not backward in representing their behaviour as the effect of
disaffection; nor was Elizabeth likely to recede, where both her
authority and her revenue were apparently concerned. But,
after some demonstrations of resentment in committing the
delegates to the Tower, she took alarm at the clamours of their
countrymen; and, aware that the King of Spain was ready to
throw troops into Ireland, desisted with that prudence which
always kept her passion in command, accepting a voluntary
composition for seven years in the accustomed manner.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>James I. ascended the throne with as great advantages in
Ireland as in his other kingdoms. That island was already
pacified by the submission of Tyrone; and all was prepared
for a final establishment of the English power upon the basis
of equal laws and civilised customs; a reformation which in
some respects the king was not ill fitted to introduce. His
reign is perhaps on the whole the most important in the constitutional
history of Ireland, and that from which the present
scheme of society in that country is chiefly to be deduced.</p>

<p>1. The laws of supremacy and uniformity, copied from those
of England, were incompatible with any exercise of the Roman
catholic worship, or with the admission of any members of that
church into civil trust. It appears indeed that they were by
no means strictly executed during the queen's reign; yet the
priests were of course excluded, so far as the English authority
prevailed, from their churches and benefices; the former were
chiefly ruined; the latter fell to protestant strangers, or to
conforming ministers of native birth, dissolute and ignorant,
as careless to teach as the people were predetermined not to
listen.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
 The priests, many of them, engaged in a conspiracy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
with the court of Spain against the queen and her successor,
and all deeming themselves unjustly and sacrilegiously despoiled,
kept up the spirit of disaffection, or at least of resistance to
religious innovation, throughout the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
 The accession
of James seemed a sort of signal for casting off the yoke of
heresy; in Cork, Waterford, and other cities, the people, not
without consent of the magistrates, rose to restore the catholic
worship; they seized the churches, ejected the ministers,
marched in public processions, and shut their gates against the
lord deputy. He soon reduced them to obedience; but almost
the whole nation was of the same faith, and disposed to struggle
for a public toleration. This was beyond every question their
natural right, and as certainly was it the best policy of England
to have granted it; but the king-craft and the priest-craft of
the day taught other lessons. Priests were ordered by proclamation
to quit the realm; the magistrates and chief citizens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
of Dublin were committed to prison for refusing to frequent
the protestant church. The gentry of the pale remonstrated
at the court of Westminster; and, though their delegates atoned
for their self-devoted courage by imprisonment, the secret
menace of expostulation seems to have produced, as usual, some
effect, in a direction to the lord deputy that he should endeavour
to conciliate the recusants by instruction. These penalties of
recusancy, from whatever cause, were very little enforced; but
the catholics murmured at the oath of supremacy, which shut
them out from every distinction: though here again the execution
of the law was sometimes mitigated, they justly thought
themselves humiliated, and the liberties of their country endangered,
by standing thus at the mercy of the Crown. And
it is plain that, even within the pale, the compulsory statutes
were at least far better enforced than under the queen; while
in those provinces within which the law now first began to have
its course, the difference was still more acutely perceived.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
</p>

<p>2. <i>English law established throughout Ireland.</i>&mdash;The first care
of the new administration was to perfect the reduction of
Ireland into a civilised kingdom. Sheriffs were appointed
throughout Ulster; the territorial divisions of counties and
baronies were extended to the few districts that still wanted
them; the judges of assize went their circuits everywhere; the
customs of tanistry and gavelkind were determined by the court
of king's bench to be void; the Irish lords surrendered their
estates to the Crown, and received them back by the English
tenures of knight-service or socage; an exact account was taken
of the lands each of these chieftains possessed, that he might
be invested with none but those he occupied; while his tenants,
exempted from those uncertain Irish exactions, the source of
their servitude and misery, were obliged only to an annual quit-rent,
and held their own lands by a free tenure. The king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
writ was obeyed, at least in profession, throughout Ireland;
after four centuries of lawlessness and misgovernment, a golden
period was anticipated by the English courtiers; nor can we
hesitate to recognise the influence of enlightened, and sometimes
of benevolent minds, in the scheme of government now carried
into effect.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
 But two unhappy maxims debased their motives,
and discredited their policy; the first, that none but the true
religion, or the state's religion, could be suffered to exist in the
eye of the law; the second, that no pretext could be too harsh
or iniquitous to exclude men of a different race or erroneous
faith from their possessions.</p>

<p>3. <i>Settlements of English in Munster, Ulster, and other parts.</i>&mdash;The
suppression of Slanes O'Neil's revolt in 1567 seems to have
suggested the thought, or afforded the means, of perfecting the
conquest of Ireland by the same methods that had been used
to commence it, an extensive plantation of English colonists.
The law of forfeiture came in very conveniently to further this
great scheme of policy. O'Neil was attainted in the parliament
of 1569; the territories which acknowledged him as chieftain,
comprising a large part of Down and Antrim, were vested in
the Crown; and a natural son of Sir Thomas Smith, secretary
of state, who is said to have projected this settlement, was sent
with a body of English to take possession of the lands thus
presumed in law to be vacant. This expedition however failed
of success; the native occupants not acquiescing in this doctrine
of our lawyers.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
 But fresh adventurers settled in different parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
of Ireland; and particularly after the Earl of Desmond's
rebellion in 1583, whose forfeiture was reckoned at 574,628
Irish acres, though it seems probable that this is more than
double the actual confiscation.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
 These lands in the counties of
Cork and Kerry, left almost desolate by the oppression of the
Geraldines themselves, and the far greater cruelty of the government
in subduing them, were parcelled out among English
undertakers at low rents, but on condition of planting eighty-six
families on an estate of 12,000 acres; and in like proportion
for smaller possessions. None of the native Irish were to be
admitted as tenants; but neither this nor the other conditions
were strictly observed by the undertakers, and the colony
suffered alike by their rapacity and their neglect.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
 The oldest
of the second race of English families in Ireland are found among
the descendants of these Munster colonists. We find among
them also some distinguished names, that have left no memorial
in their posterity; Sir Walter Raleigh, who here laid the foundation
of his transitory success, and one not less in glory, and
hardly less in misfortune, Edmund Spenser. In a country
house once belonging to the Desmonds, on the banks of the
Mulla, near Doneraile, the three first books of the <i>Faery Queen</i>
were written; and here too the poet awoke to the sad realities
of life, and has left us, in his <i>Account of the State of Ireland</i>, the
most full and authentic document that illustrates its condition.
This treatise abounds with judicious observations; but we regret
the disposition to recommend an extreme severity in dealing with
the native Irish, which ill becomes the sweetness of his muse.</p>

<p>The two great native chieftains of the north, the Earls of Tyrone
and Tyrconnel, a few years after the king's accession, engaged,
or were charged with having engaged, in some new conspiracy,
and flying from justice, were attainted of treason. Five
hundred thousand acres in Ulster were thus forfeited to the
Crown; and on this was laid the foundation of that great colony,
which has rendered that province, from being the seat of the
wildest natives, the most flourishing, the most protestant, and
the most enlightened part of Ireland. This plantation, though
projected no doubt by the king and by Lord Bacon, was chiefly
carried into effect by the lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester,
a man of great capacity, judgment, and prudence. He caused
surveys to be taken of the several counties, fixed upon proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
places for building castles or founding towns, and advised that
the lands should be assigned, partly to English or Scots undertakers,
partly to servitors of the Crown, as they were called,
men who had possessed civil or military offices in Ireland,
partly to the old Irish, even some of those who had been concerned
in Tyrone's rebellion. These and their tenants were
exempted from the oath of supremacy imposed on the new
planters. From a sense of the error committed in the queen's
time by granting vast tracts to single persons, the lands were
distributed in three classes, of 2000, 1500, and 1000 English
acres; and in every county one-half of the assignments was
to the smallest, the rest to the other two classes. Those who
received 2000 acres were bound within four years to build a
castle and bawn, or strong court-yard; the second class within
two years to build a stone or brick house with a bawn; the
third class a bawn only. The first were to plant on their lands
within three years forty-eight able men, eighteen years old or
upwards, born in England or the inland parts of Scotland; the
others to do the same in proportion to their estates. All the
grantees were to reside within five years, in person or by approved
agents, and to keep sufficient store of arms; they were not to
alienate their lands without the king's licence, nor to let them
for less than twenty-one years; their tenants were to live in
houses built in the English manner, and not dispersed, but in
villages. The natives held their lands by the same conditions,
except that of building fortified houses; but they were bound
to take no Irish exactions from their tenants, nor to suffer the
practice of wandering with their cattle from place to place.
In this manner were these escheated lands of Ulster divided
among a hundred and four English and Scots undertakers, fifty-six
servitors, and two hundred and eighty-six natives. All
lands which through the late anarchy and change of religion
had been lost to the church were restored; and some further
provision was made for the beneficed clergy. Chichester, as
was just, received an allotment in a far ampler measure than
the common servants of the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
</p>

<p>This noble design was not altogether completed according to
the platform. The native Irish, to whom some regard was
shown by these regulations, were less equitably dealt with by
the colonists, and by those other adventurers whom England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
continually sent forth to enrich themselves and maintain her
sovereignty. Pretexts were sought to establish the Crown's
title over the possessions of the Irish; they were assailed through
a law which they had but just adopted, and of which they knew
nothing, by the claims of a litigious and encroaching prerogative,
against which no prescription could avail, nor any plea of fairness
and equity obtain favour in the sight of English-born
judges. Thus, in the King and Queen's counties, and in those
of Leitrim, Longford, and Westmeath, 385,000 acres were
adjudged to the Crown, and 66,000 in that of Wicklow. The
greater part was indeed regranted to the native owners on a
permanent tenure; and some apology might be found for this
harsh act of power in the means it gave of civilising those central
regions, always the shelter of rebels and robbers; yet this did
not take off the sense of forcible spoliation, which every foreign
tyranny renders so intolerable. Surrenders were extorted by
menaces; juries refusing to find the Crown's title were fined by
the council; many were dispossessed without any compensation,
and sometimes by gross perjury, sometimes by barbarous
cruelty. It is said that in the county of Longford the Irish
had scarcely one-third of their former possessions assigned to
them, out of three-fourths which had been intended by the
king. Those who had been most faithful, those even who had
conformed to the protestant church, were little better treated
than the rest. Hence, though in many new plantations great
signs of improvement were perceptible, though trade and tillage
increased, and towns were built, a secret rankling for those
injuries was at the heart of Ireland; and in these two leading
grievances, the penal laws against recusants, and the inquisition
into defective titles, we trace, beyond a shadow of doubt, the
primary source of the rebellion in 1641.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>

<p>4. <i>Constitution of Irish parliament.</i>&mdash;Before the reign of James,
Ireland had been regarded either as a conquered country, or
as a mere colony of English, according to the persons or the
provinces which were in question. The whole island now took
a common character, that of a subordinate kingdom, inseparable
from the English Crown, and dependent also, at least as was
taken for granted by our lawyers, on the English legislature;
but governed after the model of our constitution, by nearly the
same laws, and claiming entirely the same liberties. It was a
natural consequence, that an Irish parliament should represent,
or affect to represent, every part of the kingdom. None of
Irish blood had ever sat, either lords or commoners, till near
the end of Henry VIII.'s reign. The representation of the
twelve counties, into which Munster and part of Leinster were
divided, and of a few towns, which existed in the reign of Edward
III., if not later, was reduced by the defection of so many
English families to the limits of the four shires of the pale.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>

The old counties, when they returned to their allegiance under
Henry VIII., and those afterwards formed by Mary and Elizabeth,
increased the number of the Commons: though in that
of 1567, as has been mentioned, the writs for some of them were
arbitrarily withheld. The two queens did not neglect to create
new boroughs, in order to balance the more independent representatives
of the old Anglo-Irish families by the English
retainers of the court. Yet it is said that in seventeen counties
out of thirty-two, into which Ireland was finally parcelled, there
was no town that returned burgesses to parliament before the
reign of James I., and the whole number in the rest was but
about thirty.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
 He created at once forty new boroughs, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
possibly rather more; for the number of the Commons, in 1613,
appears to have been 232.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
 It was several times afterwards
augmented, and reached its complement of 300 in 1692.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
 These
grants of the elective franchise were made, not indeed improvidently,
but with very sinister intents towards the freedom of
parliament; two-thirds of an Irish House of Commons, as it
stood in the eighteenth century, being returned with the mere
farce of election by wretched tenants of the aristocracy.</p>

<p>The province of Connaught, with the adjoining county of
Clare, was still free from the intrusion of English colonists.
The Irish had complied, both under Elizabeth and James, with
the usual conditions of surrendering their estates to the Crown
in order to receive them back by a legal tenure. But, as these
grants, by some negligence, had not been duly enrolled in
Chancery (though the proprietors had paid large fees for that
security), the council were not ashamed to suggest, or the king
to adopt, an iniquitous scheme of declaring the whole country
forfeited, in order to form another plantation as extensive as
that of Ulster. The remonstrances of those whom such a project
threatened put a present stop to it; and Charles, on ascending
the throne, found it better to hear the proposals of his Irish
subjects for a composition. After some time, it was agreed
between the court and the Irish agents in London, that the
kingdom should voluntarily contribute £120,000 in three years
by equal payments, in return for certain graces, as they were
called, which the king was to bestow. These went to secure
the subject's title to his lands against the Crown after sixty
years' possession, and gave the people of Connaught leave to
enrol their grants, relieving also the settlers in Ulster or other
places from the penalties they had incurred by similar neglect.
The abuses of the council-chamber in meddling with private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
causes, the oppression of the court of wards, the encroachments
of military authority, and excesses of the soldiers were restrained.
A free trade with the king's dominions or those of friendly
powers was admitted. The recusants were allowed to sue for
livery of their estates in the court of wards, and to practise in
courts of law, on taking an oath of mere allegiance instead of
that of supremacy. Unlawful exactions and severities of the
clergy were prohibited. These reformations of unquestionable
and intolerable evils, as beneficial as those contained nearly at
the same moment in the Petition of Right, would have saved
Ireland long ages of calamity, if they had been as faithfully
completed as they seemed to be graciously conceded. But
Charles I. emulated, on this occasion, the most perfidious tyrants.
It had been promised by an article in these graces, that a parliament
should be held to confirm them. Writs of summons were
accordingly issued by the lord deputy; but with no consideration
of that fundamental rule established by Poyning's law,
that no parliament should be held in Ireland until the king's
licence be obtained. This irregularity was of course discovered
in England, and the writs of summons declared to be void.
It would have been easy to remedy this mistake, if such it
were, by proceeding in the regular course with a royal licence.
But this was withheld; no parliament was called for a
considerable time; and, when the three years had elapsed
during which the voluntary contribution had been payable,
the king threatened to straiten his graces if it were not
renewed.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
</p>

<p>He had now placed in the vice-royalty of Ireland that star of
exceeding brightness, but sinister influence, the willing and able
instrument of despotic power, Lord Strafford. In his eyes the
country he governed belonged to the Crown by right of conquest;
neither the original natives, nor even the descendants of the
conquerors themselves, possessing any privileges which could
interfere with its sovereignty. He found two parties extremely
jealous of each other, yet each loth to recognise an absolute
prerogative, and thus in some measure having a common cause.
The protestants, not a little from bigotry, but far more from a
persuasion that they held their estates on the tenure of a rigid
religious monopoly, could not endure to hear of a toleration
of popery, which, though originally demanded, was not even
mentioned in the king's graces; and disapproved the indulgence
shown by those graces to recusants, which is said to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
followed by an impolitic ostentation of the Romish worship.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>

They objected to a renewal of the contribution both as the price
of this dangerous tolerance of recusancy, and as debarring the
protestant subjects of their constitutional right to grant money
only in parliament. Wentworth, however, insisted upon its
payment for another year, at the expiration of which a parliament
was to be called.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
</p>

<p>The king did not come without reluctance into this last
measure, hating, as he did, the very name of parliament; but
the lord deputy confided in his own energy to make it innoxious
and serviceable. They conspired together how to extort the
most from Ireland, and concede the least; Charles, in truth,
showing a most selfish indifference to anything but his own
revenue, and a most dishonourable unfaithfulness to his word.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>

The parliament met in 1634, with a strong desire of insisting on
the confirmation of the graces they had already paid for; but
Wentworth had so balanced the protestant and recusant parties,
employed so skilfully the resources of fair promises and intimidation,
that he procured six subsidies to be granted before a
prorogation, without any mutual concession from the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
It had been agreed that a second session should be held for
confirming the graces; but in this, as might be expected, the
supplies having been provided, the request of both houses that
they might receive the stipulated reward met with a cold
reception; and ultimately the most essential articles, those
establishing a sixty years' prescription against the Crown, and
securing the titles of proprietors in Clare and Connaught, as
well as those which relieved the catholics in the court of wards
from the oath of supremacy, were laid aside. Statutes, on the
other hand, were borrowed from England, especially that of uses,
which cut off the methods they had hitherto employed for
evading the law's severity.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
</p>

<p>Strafford had always determined to execute the project of
the late reign with respect to the western counties. He proceeded
to hold an inquisition in each county of Connaught, and
summoned juries in order to preserve a mockery of justice in
the midst of tyranny. They were required to find the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
title to all the lands, on such evidence as could be found and was
thought fit to be laid before them; and were told that what
would be best for their own interests would be to return such a
verdict as the king desired, what would be best for his, to do the
contrary; since he was able to establish it without their consent,
and wished only to invest them graciously with a large part of
what they now unlawfully withheld from him. These menaces
had their effect in all counties except that of Galway, where a
jury stood out obstinately against the Crown, and being in
consequence, as well as the sheriff, summoned to the castle in
Dublin, were sentenced to an enormous fine. Yet the remonstrances
of the western proprietors were so clamorous that no
steps were immediately taken for carrying into effect the designed
plantation; and the great revolutions of Scotland and
England which soon ensued gave another occupation to the
mind of Lord Strafford.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
 It has never been disputed that a
more uniform administration of justice in ordinary cases, a
stricter coercion of outrage, a more extensive commerce, evidenced
by the augmentation of customs, above all the foundation
of the great linen manufacture in Ulster, distinguished the
period of his government.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
 But it is equally manifest that
neither the reconcilement of parties, nor their affection to the
English Crown, could be the result of his arbitrary domination;
and that, having healed no wound he found, he left others to
break out after his removal. The despotic violence of this
minister towards private persons, and those of great eminence,
is in some instances well known by the proceedings on his impeachment,
and in others is sufficiently familiar by our historical
and biographical literature. It is indeed remarkable that we
find among the objects of his oppression and insult all that most
illustrates the contemporary annals of Ireland, the venerable
learning of Usher, the pious integrity of Bedell, the experienced
wisdom of Cork, and the early virtue of Clanricarde.</p>

<p>The parliament assembled by Strafford in 1640 began with
loud professions of gratitude to the king for the excellent
governor he had appointed over them; they voted subsidies
to pay a large army raised to serve against the Scots, and seemed
eager to give every manifestation of zealous loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
 But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
after their prorogation, and during the summer of that year,
as rapid a tendency to a great revolution became visible as in
England; the Commons, when they met again, seemed no longer
the same men; and, after the fall of their great viceroy, they
coalesced with his English enemies to consummate his destruction.
Hate smothered by fear, but inflamed by the same cause,
broke forth in a remonstrance of the Commons, presented
through a committee, not to the king, but a superior power, the
long parliament of England. The two houses united to avail
themselves of the advantageous moment, and to extort, as they
very justly might, from the necessities of Charles that confirmation
of his promises which had been refused in his prosperity.
Both parties, catholic as well as protestant, acted together in
this national cause, shunning for the present to bring forward
those differences which were not the less implacable for being
thus deferred. The catalogue of temporal grievances was long
enough to produce this momentary coalition: it might be
groundless in some articles, it might be exaggerated in more,
it might in many be of ancient standing; but few can pretend
to deny that it exhibits a true picture of the misgovernment of
Ireland at all times, but especially under the Earl of Strafford.
The king, in May 1641, consented to the greater part of their
demands; but unfortunately they were never granted by law.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
</p>

<p>But the disordered condition of his affairs gave encouragement
to hopes far beyond what any parliamentary remonstrances
could realise; hopes long cherished when they had
seemed vain to the world, but such as courage, and bigotry,
and resentment would never lay aside. The court of Madrid
had not abandoned its connection with the disaffected Irish,
especially of the priesthood; the son of Tyrone, and many
followers of that cause, served in its armies; and there seems
much reason to believe that in the beginning of 1641 the project
of insurrection was formed among the expatriated Irish, not
without the concurrence of Spain, and perhaps of Richelieu.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
The government had passed from the vigorous hands of Strafford
into those of two lords justices, Sir William Parsons and Sir
John Borlase, men by no means equal to the critical circumstances
wherein they were placed, though possibly too severely censured
by those who do not look at their extraordinary difficulties with
sufficient candour. The primary causes of the rebellion are not
to be found in their supineness or misconduct, but in the two
great sins of the English government; in the penal laws as to
religion which pressed on almost the whole people, and in the
systematic iniquity which despoiled them of their possessions.
They could not be expected to miss such an occasion of revolt;
it was an hour of revolution, when liberty was won by arms,
and ancient laws were set at nought; the very success of
their worst enemies, the covenanters in Scotland, seemed the
assurance of their own victory, as it was the reproach of their
submission.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rebellion of 1641.</i>&mdash;The rebellion broke out, as is well known,
by a sudden massacre of the Scots and English in Ulster, designed
no doubt by a vindictive and bigoted people to extirpate
those races, and, if contemporary authorities are to be credited,
falling little short of this in its execution. Their evident exaggeration
has long been acknowledged; but possibly the
scepticism of later writers has extenuated rather too much the
horrors of this massacre.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
 It was certainly not the crime of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
catholics generally; nor, perhaps, in the other provinces of
Ireland are they chargeable with more cruelty than their
opponents.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
 Whatever may have been the original intentions
of the lords of the pale, or of the Anglo-Irish professing the old
religion in general (which has been a problem in history), a
few months only elapsed before they were almost universally
engaged in the war.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
 The old distinctions of Irish and English
blood were obliterated by those of religion; and it became a
desperate contention whether the majority of the nation should
be trodden to the dust by forfeiture and persecution, or the
Crown lose everything beyond a nominal sovereignty over
Ireland. The insurgents, who might once perhaps have been
content with a repeal of the penal laws, grew naturally in their
demands through success, or rather through the inability of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
English government to keep the field, and began to claim the
entire establishment of their religion; terms in themselves not
unreasonable, nor apparently disproportionate to their circumstances,
and which the king was, in his distresses, nearly ready
to concede, but such as never could have been obtained from
a third party, of whom they did not sufficiently think, the
parliament and people of England. The Commons had, at the
very beginning of the rebellion, voted that all the forfeited estates
of the insurgents should be allotted to such as should aid in
reducing the island to obedience; and thus rendered the war
desperate on the part of the Irish.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Subjugation of the Irish by Cromwell.</i>&mdash;No great efforts were
made, however, for some years; but, after the king's person had
fallen into their hands, the victorious party set themselves in
earnest to effect the conquest of Ireland. This was achieved by
Cromwell and his powerful army after several years, with such
bloodshed and rigour that, in the opinion of Lord Clarendon, the
sufferings of that nation, from the outset of the rebellion to its
close, have never been surpassed but by those of the Jews in
their destruction by Titus.</p>

<p><i>Restoration of Charles II.</i>&mdash;At the restoration of Charles II.
there were in Ireland two people, one either of native, or old
English blood, the other of recent settlement; one catholic, the
other protestant; one humbled by defeat, the other insolent
with victory; one regarding the soil as his ancient inheritance,
the other as his acquisition and reward. There were three
religions; for the Scots of Ulster and the army of Cromwell had
never owned the episcopal church, which for several years had
fallen almost as low as that of Rome. There were claims, not
easily set aside on the score of right, to the possession of lands,
which the entire island could not satisfy. In England, little more
had been necessary than to revive a suspended constitution: in
Ireland, it was something beyond a new constitution and code of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
law that was required; it was the titles and boundaries of each
man's private estate that were to be litigated and adjudged.
The episcopal church was restored with no delay, as never having
been abolished by law; and a parliament, containing no catholics
and not many vehement nonconformists, proceeded to the great
work of settling the struggles of opposite claimants, by a fresh
partition of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Act of Settlement.</i>&mdash;The king had already published a declaration
for the settlement of Ireland, intended as the basis of an
act of parliament. The adventurers, or those who, on the faith
of several acts passed in England in 1642, with the assent of the
late king, had advanced money for quelling the rebellion, in
consideration of lands to be allotted to them in certain stipulated
proportions, and who had, in general, actually received them
from Cromwell, were confirmed in all the lands possessed by
them on the 7th of May 1659; and all the deficiencies were to
be supplied before the next year. The army was confirmed in
the estates already allotted for their pay, with an exception, of
church lands, and some others. Those officers who had served
in the royal army against the Irish before 1649 were to be
satisfied for their pay, at least to the amount of five-eighths,
out of lands to be allotted for that purpose. Innocent papists,
that is, such as were not concerned in the rebellion, and whom
Cromwell had arbitrarily transplanted into Connaught, were to
be restored to their estates, and those who possessed them to be
indemnified. Those who had submitted to the peace of 1648,
and had not been afterwards in arms, if they had not accepted
lands in Connaught, were also to be restored, as soon as those
who now possessed them should be satisfied for their expenses.
Those who had served the king abroad, and thirty-six enumerated
persons of the Irish nobility and gentry, were to be put on the
same footing as the last. The precedency of restitution, an
important point where the claims exceeded the means of satisfying
them, was to be in the order above specified.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
</p>

<p>This declaration was by no means pleasing to all concerned.
The loyal officers, who had served before 1649, murmured that
they had little prospect of more than twelve shillings and
sixpence in the pound, while the republican army of Cromwell
would receive the full value. The Irish were more loud in their
complaints; no one was to be held innocent who had been in
the rebel quarters before the cessation of 1643; and other qualifications
were added so severe that hardly any could expect to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
come within them. In the House of Commons the majority,
consisting very much of the new interests, that is, of the adventurers
and army, were in favour of adhering to the declaration.
In the House of Lords it was successfully urged that, by
gratifying the new men to the utmost, no fund would be left
for indemnifying the loyalists, or the innocent Irish. It was
proposed that, if the lands not yet disposed of should not be
sufficient to satisfy all the interests for which the king had
meant to provide by his declaration, there should be a proportional
defalcation out of every class for the benefit of the
whole. These discussions were adjourned to London, where
delegates of the different parties employed every resource of
intrigue at the English court. The king's natural bias towards
the religion of the Irish had rendered him their friend; and they
seemed, at one time, likely to reverse much that had been
intended against them; but their agents grew rash with hope,
assumed a tone of superiority which ill became their condition,
affected to justify their rebellion, and finally so much disgusted
their sovereign that he ordered the act of settlement to be sent
back with little alteration, except the insertion of some more
Irish nominees.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
</p>

<p>The execution of this act was intrusted to English commissioners,
from whom it was reasonable to hope for an impartiality
which could not be found among the interested classes. Notwithstanding
the rigorous proofs nominally exacted, more of
the Irish were pronounced innocent than the Commons had
expected; and the new possessors having the sway of that
assembly, a clamour was raised that the popish interest had
prevailed; some talked of defending their estates by arms, some
even meddled in fanatical conspiracies against the government;
it was insisted that a closer inquisition should be made, and
stricter qualifications demanded. The manifest deficiency of
lands to supply all the claimants for whom the act of settlement
provided, made it necessary to resort to a supplemental measure,
called the act of explanation. The adventurers and soldiers
relinquished one-third of the estates enjoyed by them on the
7th of May 1659. Twenty Irish nominees were added to those
who were to be restored by the king's favour; but all those
who had not already been adjudged innocent, more than three
thousand in number, were absolutely cut off from any hope of
restitution. The great majority of these no question were
guilty; yet they justly complained of this confiscation without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
trial.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
 Upon the whole result, the Irish catholics having previously
held about two-thirds of the kingdom, lost more than one-half
of their possessions by forfeiture on account of their rebellion.
If we can rely at all on the calculations, made almost in the
infancy of political arithmetic by one of its most diligent investigators,
they were diminished also by much more than one-third
through the calamities of that period.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
</p>

<p>It is more easy to censure the particular inequalities, or even,
in some respects, injustice of the act of settlement, than to point
out what better course was to have been adopted. The readjustment
of all private rights after so entire a destruction of
their landmarks could only be effected by the coarse process of
general rules. Nor does it appear that the catholics, considered
as a great mass, could reasonably murmur against the confiscation
of half their estates, after a civil war wherein it is
evident that so large a proportion of themselves were concerned.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>

Charles, it is true, had not been personally resisted by the insurgents;
but, as chief of England, he stood in the place of
Cromwell, and equally represented the sovereignty of the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
island over the lesser, which under no form of government it
would concede.</p>

<p>The catholics, however, thought themselves oppressed by the
act of settlement; and could not forgive the Duke of Ormond
for his constant regard to the protestant interests, and the
supremacy of the English Crown. They had enough to encourage
them in the king's bias towards their religion, which he was
able to manifest more openly than in England. Under the
administration of Lord Berkely in 1670, at the time of Charles's
conspiracy with the King of France to subvert religion and
liberty, they began to menace an approaching change, and to
aim at revoking, or materially weakening, the act of settlement.
The most bigoted and insolent of the popish clergy, who had
lately rejected with indignation an offer of more reasonable men
to renounce the tenets obnoxious to civil governments, were
countenanced at Dublin; but the first alarm of the new proprietors,
as well as the general apprehension of the court's
designs in England, soon rendered it necessary to desist from
the projected innovations.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
 The next reign, of course, reanimated
the Irish party; a dispensing prerogative set aside all
the statutes; every civil office, the courts of justice, and the
privy council, were filled with catholics; the protestant soldiers
were disbanded; the citizens of that religion were disarmed;
the tithes were withheld from their clergy; they were suddenly
reduced to feel that bitter condition of a conquered and proscribed
people, which they had long rendered the lot of their
enemies.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
 From these enemies, exasperated by bigotry and
revenge, they could have nothing but a full and exceeding
measure of retaliation to expect; nor had they even the last hope
that an English king, for the sake of his Crown and country,
must protect those who formed the strongest link between the
two islands. A man violent and ambitious, without superior
capacity, the Earl of Tyrconnel, lord lieutenant in 1687, and
commander of the army, looked only to his master's interests,
in subordination to those of his countrymen, and of his own. It
is now ascertained that, doubtful of the king's success in the
struggle for restoring popery in England, he had made secret
overtures to some of the French agents for casting off all connection
with that kingdom, in case of James's death, and, with
the aid of Louis, placing the crown of Ireland on his own head.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<p><i>War of 1689, and final reduction of Ireland.</i>&mdash;The revolution
in England was followed by a war in Ireland of three years'
duration, and a war on both sides, like that of 1641, for self-preservation.
In the parliament held by James at Dublin in
1690, the act of settlement was repealed, and above 2000
persons attainted by name; both, it has been said, perhaps
with little truth, against the king's will, who dreaded the
impetuous nationality that was tearing away the bulwarks of
his throne.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
 But the magnanimous defence of Derry and the
splendid victory of the Boyne restored the protestant cause;
though the Irish, with the succour of French troops, maintained
for two years a gallant resistance, they could not ultimately
withstand the triple superiority of military talents, resources,
and discipline. Their bravery, however, served to obtain the
articles of Limerick on the surrender of that city; conceded by
their noble-minded conqueror, against the disposition of those
who longed to plunder and persecute their fallen enemy. By
the first of these articles, "the Roman catholics of this kingdom
shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion as are
consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the
reign of King Charles II.; and their majesties, as soon as their
affairs will permit them to summon a parliament in this kingdom,
will endeavour to procure the said Roman catholics such
further security in that particular as may preserve them from
any disturbance upon the account of their said religion." The
second secures to the inhabitants of Limerick and other places
then in possession of the Irish, and to all officers and soldiers
then in arms, who should return to their majesties' obedience,
and to all such as should be under their protection in the counties
of Limerick, Kerry, Clare, Galway, and Mayo, all their estates,
and all their rights, privileges, and immunities, which they held
in the reign of Charles II., free from all forfeitures or outlawries
incurred by them.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
</p>

<p>This second article, but only as to the garrison of Limerick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
or other persons in arms, is confirmed by statute some years
afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
 The first article seems, however, to be passed
over. The forfeitures on account of the rebellion, estimated at
1,060,792 acres, were somewhat diminished by restitutions to
the ancient possessors under the capitulation; the greater part
were lavishly distributed to English grantees.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
 It appears
from hence, that at the end of the seventeenth century, the
Irish or Anglo-Irish catholics could hardly possess above one-sixth
or one-seventh of the kingdom. They were still formidable
from their numbers and their sufferings; and the victorious
party saw no security but in a system of oppression, contained
in a series of laws during the reigns of William and Anne, which
have scarce a parallel in European history, unless it be that of
the protestants in France, after the revocation of the edict of
Nantes, who yet were but a feeble minority of the whole people.
No papist was allowed to keep a school, or to teach in any private
houses, except the children of the family.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
 Severe penalties
were denounced against such as should go themselves or send
others for education beyond seas in the Romish religion; and,
on probable information given to a magistrate, the burthen of
proving the contrary was thrown on the accused; the offence
not to be tried by a jury, but by justices at quarter sessions.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>

Intermarriages between persons of different religion, and possessing
any estate in Ireland, were forbidden; the children, in
case of either parent being protestant, might be taken from the
other, to be educated in that faith.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
 No papist could be guardian
to any child; but the court of chancery might appoint
some relation or other person to bring up the ward in the
protestant religion.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
 The eldest son, being a protestant, might
turn his father's estate in fee simple into a tenancy for life, and
thus secure his own inheritance. But if the children were all
papists, the father's lands were to be of the nature of gavel-kind,
and descend equally among them. Papists were disabled from
purchasing lands, except for terms of not more than thirty-one
years, at a rent not less than two-thirds of the full value. They
were even to conform within six months after any title should
accrue by descent, devise, or settlement, on pain of forfeiture
to the next protestant heir; a provision which seems intended
to exclude them from real property altogether, and to render
the others almost supererogatory.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
 Arms, says the poet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
remain to the plundered; but the Irish legislature knew that
the plunder would be imperfect and insecure while arms remained;
no papist was permitted to retain them, and search
might be made at any time by two justices.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
 The bare celebration
of catholic rites was not subjected to any fresh penalties;
but regular priests, bishops, and others claiming jurisdiction,
and all who should come into the kingdom from foreign parts,
were banished on pain of transportation, in case of neglecting to
comply, and of high treason in case of returning from banishment.
Lest these provisions should be evaded, priests were
required to be registered; they were forbidden to leave their
own parishes; and rewards were held out to informers who
should detect the violations of these statutes, to be levied on
the popish inhabitants of the country.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
 To have exterminated
the catholics by the sword, or expelled them, like the Moriscoes
of Spain, would have been little more repugnant to justice and
humanity, but incomparably more politic.</p>

<p><i>Dependence of the Irish upon the English parliament.</i>&mdash;It may
easily be supposed, that no political privileges would be left to
those who were thus debarred of the common rights of civil
society. The Irish parliament had never adopted the act passed
in the 5th of Elizabeth, imposing the oath of supremacy on the
members of the Commons. It had been full of catholics under
the queen and her two next successors. In the second session
of 1641, after the flames of rebellion had enveloped almost all
the island, the House of Commons were induced to exclude, by
a resolution of their own, those who would not take that oath;
a step which can only be judged in connection with the general
circumstances of Ireland at that awful crisis.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
 In the parliament
of 1661, no catholic, or only one, was returned;<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
 but the
house addressed the lords justices to issue a commission for
administering the oath of supremacy to all its members. A bill
passed the Commons in 1663, for imposing that oath in future,
which was stopped by a prorogation; and the Duke of Ormond
seems to have been adverse to it.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
 An act of the English
parliament after the revolution, reciting that "great disquiet
and many dangerous attempts have been made to deprive their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
majesties and their royal predecessors of the said realm of
Ireland by the liberty which the popish recusants there have
had and taken to sit and vote in parliament," requires every
member of both houses of parliament to take the new oaths of
allegiance and supremacy, and to subscribe the declaration
against transubstantiation before taking his seat.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
 This statute
was adopted and enacted by the Irish parliament in 1782, after
they had renounced the legislative supremacy of England under
which it had been enforced. The elective franchise, which had
been rather singularly spared in an act of Anne, was taken away
from the Roman catholics of Ireland in 1715; or, as some think,
not absolutely till 1727.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
</p>

<p>These tremendous statutes had in some measure the effect
which their framers designed. The wealthier families, against
whom they were principally levelled, conformed in many
instances to the protestant church.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
 The catholics were extinguished
as a political body; and, though any willing allegiance
to the house of Hanover would have been monstrous, and
it is known that their bishops were constantly nominated to the
pope by the Stuart princes,<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
 they did not manifest at any period,
or even during the rebellions of 1715 and 1745, the least movement
towards a disturbance of the government. Yet for thirty
years after the accession of George I. they continued to be
insulted in public proceedings under the name of the common
enemy, sometimes oppressed by the enactment of new statutes,
or the stricter execution of the old; till in the latter years of
George II. their peaceable deportment, and the rise of a more
generous spirit among the Irish protestants, not only sheathed
the fangs of the law, but elicited expressions of esteem from the
ruling powers, which they might justly consider as the pledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
of a more tolerant policy. The mere exercise of their religion
in an obscure manner had long been permitted without molestation.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
</p>

<p>Thus in Ireland there were three nations, the original natives,
the Anglo-Irish, and the new English; the two former catholic,
except some chiefly of the upper classes, who had conformed
to the church; the last wholly protestant. There were three
religions, the Roman catholic, the established or Anglican, and
the presbyterian; more than one-half of the protestants, according
to the computation of those times, belonging to the latter
denomination.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
 These however in a less degree were under the
ban of the law as truly as the catholics themselves; they were
excluded from all civil and military offices by a test act, and
even their religious meetings were denounced by penal statutes.
Yet the House of Commons after the revolution always contained
a strong presbyterian body, and unable, as it seems, to obtain
an act of indemnity for those who had taken commissions in
the militia, while the rebellion of 1715 was raging in Great
Britain, had recourse to a resolution, that whoever should
prosecute any dissenter for accepting such a commission is an
enemy to the king and the protestant interest.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
 They did not
even obtain a legal toleration till 1720.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
 It seems as if the
connection of the two islands, and the whole system of constitutional
laws in the lesser, subsisted only for the sake of securing
the privileges and emoluments of a small number of ecclesiastics,
frequently strangers, who rendered very little return for their
enormous monopoly. A great share, in fact, of the temporal
government under George II. was thrown successively into the
hands of two primates, Boulter and Stone; the one a worthy
but narrow-minded man, who showed his egregious ignorance
of policy in endeavouring to promote the wealth and happiness
of the people, whom he at the same time studied to depress and
discourage in respect of political freedom; the other an able,
but profligate and ambitious statesman, whose name is mingled,
as an object of odium and enmity, with the first great struggles
of Irish patriotism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>The new Irish nation, or rather the protestant nation, since
all distinctions of origin have, from the time of the great rebellion,
been merged in those of religion, partook in large measure
of the spirit that was poured out on the advocates of liberty
and the revolution in the sister kingdom. Their parliament
was always strongly whig, and scarcely manageable during the
later years of the queen. They began to assimilate themselves
more and more to the English model, and to cast off by degrees
the fetters that galled and degraded them. By Poyning's
celebrated law, the initiative power was reserved to the English
council. This act, at one time popular in Ireland, was afterwards
justly regarded as destructive of the rights of their
parliament, and a badge of the nation's dependence. It was
attempted by the Commons in 1641, and by the catholic confederates
in the rebellion, to procure its repeal; which Charles I.
steadily refused, till he was driven to refuse nothing. In his
son's reign, it is said that "the council framed bills altogether;
a negative alone on them and their several provisoes was left
to parliament; only a general proposition for a bill by way of
address to the lord lieutenant and council came from parliament;
nor was it till after the revolution that heads of bills
were presented; these last in fact resembled acts of parliament
or bills, with only the small difference of 'We pray that it may
be enacted,' instead of 'Be it enacted.'"<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
 They assumed
about the same time the examination of accounts, and of the
expenditure of public money.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as they gradually emancipated themselves from
the ascendancy of the Crown, they found a more formidable
power to contend with in the English parliament. It was
acknowledged, by all at least of the protestant name, that the
Crown of Ireland was essentially dependent on that of England,
and subject to any changes that might affect the succession of
the latter. But the question as to the subordination of her
legislature was of a different kind. The precedents and authorities
of early ages seem not decisive; so far as they extend,
they rather countenance the opinion that English statutes were
of themselves valid in Ireland. But from the time of Henry VI.
or Edward IV. it was certainly established that they had no
operation, unless enacted by the Irish parliament. This however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
would not legally prove that they might not be binding,
if express words to that effect were employed; and such was
the doctrine of Lord Coke and of other English lawyers. This
came into discussion about the eventful period of 1641. The
Irish in general protested against the legislative authority of
England, as a novel theory which could not be maintained;<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>

and two treatises on the subject, one ascribed to Lord Chancellor
Bolton, or more probably to an eminent lawyer, Patrick Darcy,
for the independence of Ireland, another, in answer to it, by
Serjeant Mayart, may be read in the <i>Hibernica</i> of Harris.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>

Very few instances occurred before the revolution, wherein the
English parliament thought fit to include Ireland in its enactments,
and none perhaps wherein they were carried into effect.
But after the revolution several laws of great importance were
passed in England to bind the other kingdom, and acquiesced
in without express opposition by its parliament. Molyneux,
however, in his celebrated <i>Case of Ireland's being bound by Acts
of Parliament in England stated</i>, published in 1697, set up the
claim of his country for absolute legislative independency.
The House of Commons at Westminster came to resolutions
against this book; and, with their high notions of parliamentary
sovereignty, were not likely to desist from a pretension which,
like the very similar claim to impose taxes in America, sprung
in fact from the semi-republican scheme of constitutional law
established by means of the revolution.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>
 It is evident that
while the sovereignty and enacting power was supposed to
reside wholly in the king, and only the power of consent to the
two houses of parliament, it was much less natural to suppose
a control of the English legislature over other dominions of the
Crown, having their own representation for similar purposes,
than after they had become, in effect and in general sentiment,
though not quite in the statute-book, co-ordinate partakers of
the supreme authority. The Irish parliament, however, advancing
as it were in a parallel line, had naturally imbibed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
same sense of its own supremacy, and made at length an effort
to assert it. A judgment from the court of exchequer in 1719
having been reversed by the House of Lords, an appeal was
brought before the Lords in England, who affirmed the judgment
of the exchequer. The Irish Lords resolved that no appeal lay
from the court of exchequer in Ireland to the king in parliament
in Great Britain; and the barons of that court having acted in
obedience to the order of the English Lords, were taken into
the custody of the black rod. That house next addressed the
king, setting forth their reasons against admitting the appellant
jurisdiction. But the Lords in England, after requesting the
king to confer some favour on the barons of the exchequer who
had been censured and illegally imprisoned for doing their duty,
ordered a bill to be brought in for better securing the dependency
of Ireland upon the Crown of Great Britain, which declares
"that the king's majesty, by and with the advice and consent
of the Lords spiritual and temporal and Commons of Great
Britain, in parliament assembled, had, hath, and of right ought
to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of
sufficient force and validity to bind the people and the kingdom
of Ireland; and that the House of Lords of Ireland have not,
nor of right ought to have, any jurisdiction to judge of, reverse,
or affirm any judgment, sentence, or decree given or made in
any court within the said kingdom; and that all proceedings
before the said House of Lords upon any such judgment, sentence,
or decree, are, and are hereby declared to be, utterly
null and void, to all intents and purposes whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
</p>

<p>The English government found no better method of counteracting
this rising spirit of independence than by bestowing the
chief posts in the state and church on strangers, in order to
keep up what was called the English interest.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
 This wretched
policy united the natives of Ireland in jealousy and discontent,
which the latter years of Swift were devoted to inflame. It
was impossible that the kingdom should become, as it did under
George II., more flourishing through its great natural fertility,
its extensive manufacture of linen, and its facilities for commerce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
though much restricted (the domestic alarm from the papists
also being allayed by their utter prostration), without writhing
under the indignity of its subordination; or that a House of
Commons, constructed so much on the model of the English,
could hear patiently of liberties and privileges it did not enjoy.
These aspirations for equality first, perhaps, broke out into
audible complaints in the year 1753. The country was in so
thriving a state that there was a surplus revenue after payment
of all charges. The House of Commons determined to apply
this to the liquidation of a debt. The government, though not
unwilling to admit of such an application, maintained that the
whole revenue belonged to the king, and could not be disposed
of without his previous consent. In England, where the grants
of parliament are appropriated according to estimates, such a
question could hardly arise; nor would there, I presume, be
the slightest doubt as to the control of the House of Commons
over a surplus income. But in Ireland, the practice of appropriation
seems never to have prevailed, at least so strictly;<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>

and the constitutional right might perhaps not unreasonably
be disputed. After long and violent discussions, wherein the
speaker of the Commons and other eminent men bore a leading
part on the popular side, the Crown was so far victorious as to
procure some motions to be carried, which seemed to imply its
authority; but the house took care, by more special applications
of the revenue, to prevent the recurrence of an undisposed
surplus.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
 From this era the great parliamentary history of
Ireland begins, and is terminated after half a century by the
union: a period fruitful of splendid eloquence, and of ardent,
though not always uncompromising, patriotism; but which, of
course, is beyond the limits prescribed to these pages.</p>

 It was said in 18 Car. II. (1666) that "the king by the common law
hath a general prerogative over the printing press; so that none ought to
print a book for public use without his license." This seems, however,
to have been in the argument of counsel; but the court held that a patent
to print law-books exclusively was no monopoly. Carter's <i>Reports</i>, 89.
"Matters of state and things that concern the government," it is said in
another case, "were never left to any man's liberty to print that would."
1 <i>Mod. Reps.</i> 258. Kennet informs us that several complaints having
been made, of Lilly's <i>Grammar</i>, the use of which had been prescribed by
the royal ecclesiastical supremacy, it was thought proper in 1664 that a
new public form of grammar should be drawn up and <i>approved in convocation</i>,
to be enjoined by the royal authority. One was accordingly brought
in by Bishop Pearson, but the matter dropped. <i>Life of Charles II.</i> 274.</p>

 This declaration of the judges is recorded in the following passage of
the <i>London Gazette</i>, May 5, 1680: "This day the judges made their report
to his majesty in council, in pursuance of an order of this board, by which
they unanimously declare that his majesty may by law prohibit the printing
and publishing of all news-books and pamphlets of news whatsoever not
licensed by his majesty's authority, as manifestly tending to the breach of
the peace and disturbance of the kingdom. Whereupon his majesty was
pleased to direct a proclamation to be prepared for the restraining the
printing of news-books and pamphlets of news without leave." Accordingly
such a proclamation appears in the <i>Gazette</i> of May 17.</p>

 "Sir Hugh Wyndham and others of the grand jury of Somerset were
at the last assizes bound over, by Lord Ch. J. Keeling, to appear at the
K. B. the first day of this term, to answer a misdemeanour for finding
upon a bill of murder, 'billa vera quoad manslaughter,' against the
directions of the judge. Upon their appearance they were told by the
court, being full, that it was a misdemeanour in them, for they are not to
distinguish betwixt murder and manslaughter; for it is only the circumstance
of malice which makes the difference, and that may be implied by
the law, without any fact at all, and so it lies not in the judgment of a
jury, but of the judge; that the intention of their finding indictments is,
that there might be no malicious prosecution; and therefore, if the matter
of the indictment be not framed of malice, but is verisimilis, though it be
not vera, yet it answers their oaths to present it. Twisden said he had
known petty juries punished in my lord Chief Justice Hyde's time, for
disobeying of the judge's directions in point of law. But, because it was
a mistake in their judgments rather than any obstinacy, the court discharged
them without any fine or other attendance." Pasch. 19 Car. 2;

 Those who were confined by warrants were forced to buy their liberty

 In this session (Feb. 14) a committee was appointed to inspect the
laws, and consider how the king may commit any subject by his immediate
warrant, as the law now stands, and report the same to the house, and
also how the law now stands touching commitments of persons by the
council-table. Ralph supposes (p. 255) that this gave rise to the habeas
corpus act, which is certainly not the case. The statute 16 Car. I, c. 10,
seems to recognise the legality of commitments by the king's special
warrant, or by the privy council, or some, at least, of its members singly;
and I do not know whether this, with long usage, is not sufficient to support
the controverted authority of the secretary of state. As to the privy
council, it is not doubted, I believe, that they may commit. But it has
been held, even in the worst of times, that a warrant of commitment under
the king's own hand, without seal, or the hand of any secretary, or officer
of state, or justice, is bad. 2 Jac. II. B. R. 2 Shower, 484.</p>

 In the <i>Parliamentary History</i>, 845, we find a debate on the petition of
one Harrington to the Commons in 1677, who had been committed to close
custody by the council. But as his demeanour was alleged to have been
disrespectful, and the right of the council to commit was not disputed,
and especially as he seems to have been at liberty when the debate took
place, no proceedings ensued; though the commitment had not been altogether
regular. Ralph (p. 314) comments more severely on the behaviour
of the house than was necessary.</p>

 It was ordered 21 Jan. 1549, that the eldest son of the Earl of Bedford
should continue in the house after his father had succeeded to the peerage.
And, 9th Feb. 1575, that his son should do so, "according to the precedent
in the like case of the now earl his father." It is worthy of notice
that this determination, which, at the time, seems to have been thought
doubtful, though very unreasonably (Journals, 10th Feb.), but which has
had an influence which no one can fail to acknowledge, in binding together
the two branches of the legislature, and in keeping alive the sympathy
for public and popular rights in the English nobility (that <i>sensus communis</i>,
which the poet thought so rare in high rank) is first recorded, and that
twice over, in behalf of a family, in whom the love of constitutional
freedom has become hereditary, and who may be justly said to have
deserved, like the Valerii at Rome, the surname of Publicolæ.</p>

be given to the lord chancellor that he proceed to make a speedy decree
in the court of chancery, according to equity and justice, notwithstanding

Lincoln severally protested; the latter very sensibly observing, that
whereas it hath been the prudence and care of former parliaments to set
limits and bounds to the jurisdiction of chancery, now this order of
directions, which implies a command, opens a gap to set up an arbitrary
power in the chancery, which is hereby countenanced by the House of

of that court, but according to his own will. Lords' Journals, 29th Nov.

<p class="footnote">In a pamphlet by Lord Anglesea, if I mistake not, entitled, "Case stated
of the Jurisdiction of the House of Lords in point of Impositions," 1696,
a vigorous and learned defence of the right of the Lords to make alterations
in money-bills, it is admitted that they cannot increase the rates; since
that would be to originate a charge on the people, which they cannot do.
But it is even said in the year-book (33 H. 6) that if the Commons grant
tonnage for four years, and the Lords reduce the terms to two years, they
need not send the bill down again. This of course could not be supported
in modern times.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_62" id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a>
 The principles laid down by Hatsell are: 1. That in bills of supply,
the Lords can make no alteration but to correct verbal mistakes. 2. That
in bills, not of absolute supply, yet imposing burthens, as turnpike acts,
etc., the Lords cannot alter the quantum of the toll, the persons to manage
it, etc.; but in other clauses they may make amendments. 3. That,
where a charge may indirectly be thrown on the people by a bill, the
Commons object to the Lords making amendments. 4. That the Lords
cannot insert pecuniary penalties in a bill, or alter those inserted by the
Commons, iii. 137. He seems to boast that the Lords during the last
century have very faintly opposed the claim of the Commons. But surely
they have sometimes done so in practice, by returning a money-bill, or
what the lower house call one, amended; and the Commons have had
recourse to the evasion of throwing out such bill and bringing in another
with the amendments inserted in it; which does not look very triumphant.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a>
 The last instance mentioned by Hatsell is in 1790, when the Lords
had amended a bill for regulating Warwick gaol by changing the rate to
be imposed from the landowners to the occupiers, iii. 131. I am not
at present aware of any subsequent case, but rather suspect that such
might be found.</p>

 See the case of the Earl of Arundel in parliament in 1626. In one
instance the house took notice that a writ of summons had been issued to
the Earl of Mulgrave, he being under age, and addressed the king that he
would be pleased to be sparing of writs of this nature for the future.

was much under age, and would be careful for the future. 29th Oct.</p>

following observations, vol. i. p. 99: "The ancient history of boroughs
does not confirm the opinion above referred to, which Lord Chief Justice
Holt delivered in the case of Ashby <i>v.</i> White; viz. that inhabitants not
incorporated cannot send members to parliament but by prescription.
For there is good reason to believe that the elections in boroughs were in
the beginning of representation popular; yet in the reign of Edward I.
there were not perhaps thirty corporations in the kingdom. Who then
elected the members of boroughs not incorporated? Plainly, the inhabitants
or burghers [according to their tenure or situation]; for at that
time every inhabitant of a borough was called a burgess; and Hobart
refers to this usage in support of his opinion in the case of Dungannon.
The manner in which they exercised this right was the same as that in
which the inhabitants of a town, at this day, hold a right of common, or
other such privilege, which many possess who are not incorporated."
The words in brackets, which are not in the printed edition, are inserted
by the author himself in a copy bequeathed to the Inner Temple library.
The remainder of Mr. Luders's note, though too long for this place, is very
good, and successfully repels the <i>corporate</i> theory.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a>
 The following passage from Vowell's treatise, on the order of the
parliament, published in 1571, and reprinted in Holingshed's <i>Chronicles of
Ireland</i> (vi. 345) seems to indicate that, at least in practice, the election
was in the principal or governing body of the corporation. "The sheriff
of every county, having received his writ, ought, forthwith, to send his
precepts and summons to the mayors, bailiffs, and head officers of every
city, town corporate, borough, and such places as have been accustomed
to send burgesses within his county, that they do choose and elect among
themselves two citizens for every city, and two burgesses for every
borough, according to their old custom and usage. And these head
officers ought then to assemble themselves, <i>and the aldermen and common
council of every city or town</i>; and to make choice among themselves of two
able and sufficient men of every city or town, to serve for and in the said
parliament."</p>

<p class="footnote">Now, if these expressions are accurate, it certainly seems that, at this
period, the great body of freemen or inhabitants were not partakers in
the exercise of their franchise. And the following passage, if the reader
will turn to it, wherein Vowell adverts to the form of a county election,
is so differently worded in respect to the election by the freeholders at
large, that we may fairly put a literal construction upon the former. In
point of fact, I have little doubt that elections in boroughs were for the
most part very closely managed in the sixteenth century, and probably
much earlier. This, however, will not by any means decide the question
of right. For we know that in the reigns of Henry IV. and Henry V.
returns for the great county of York were made by the proxies of a few
peers and a few knights; and there is a still more anomalous case in the
reign of Elizabeth, when a Lady Packington sealed the indenture for the
county of Worcester. Carew's <i>Hist. of Elections</i>, part ii. p. 282. But no
one would pretend that the right of election was in these persons, or
supposed by any human being to be so.</p>

<p class="footnote">The difficulty to be got over by those who defend the modern decisions
of committees is this. We know that in the reign of Edward I. more than
one hundred boroughs made returns to the writ. If most of these were
not incorporated, nor had any aldermen, capital burgesses and so forth,
by whom were the elections made? Surely by the freeholders, or by the
inhabitants. And if they were so made in the reign of Edward I. how
has the franchise been restrained afterwards?</p>

 This clause in an act imposing severe penalties on bribery, was inserted
by the House of Lords with the insidious design of causing the rejection
of the whole bill; if the Commons, as might be expected, should resent
such an interference with their privileges. The ministry accordingly
endeavoured to excite this sentiment; but those who had introduced the
bill very wisely thought it better to sacrifice a point of dignity, rather
than lose so important a statute. It was, however, only carried by two
voices to agree with the amendment. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> viii. 754.</p>

 "The legal method," says Burnet, "was to have made entries, and to
have taken bonds for those duties to be paid when the parliament should
meet and renew the grant." Mr. Onslow remarks on this, that he should
have said, the least illegal and the only justifiable method. To which the
Oxford editor subjoins that it was the proposal of Lord-Keeper North,
while the other, which was adopted, was suggested by Jefferies. This
is a mistake. North's proposal was to collect the duties under the proclamation,
but to keep them apart from the other revenues in the exchequer
until the next session of parliament. There was surely little difference
in point of illegality between this and the course adopted. It was alleged
that the merchants, who had paid duty, would be injured by a temporary
importation duty free; and certainly it was inconvenient to make the
revenue dependent on such a contingency as the demise of the Crown.
But this neither justifies the proclamation, nor the disgraceful acquiescence
of the next parliament in it.</p>

<p class="footnote">The king was thanked in several addresses for directing the customs to
be levied, particularly in one from the benchers and barristers of the Middle
Temple. <i>London Gazette</i>, March 11. This was drawn by Sir Bartholomew
Shower, and presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth. <i>Life of James</i>,
vol. ii. p. 17. The former was active as a lawyer in all the worst measures
of these two reigns. Yet, after the revolution, they both became tory
patriots, and jealous assertors of freedom against the government of
William III. Barillon, however, takes notice that this illegal continuance
of the revenue produced much discontent. Fox's Appendix, 39; and
Rochester told him that North and Halifax would have urged the king to
call a parliament, in order to settle the revenue on a lawful basis, if that
resolution had not been taken by himself. <i>Id.</i> p. 20. The king thought
it necessary to apologise to Barillon for convoking parliament. <i>Id.</i> p. 18;

 For this curious piece of parliamentary inconsistency, see Reresby's
<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 113, and Barillon in the Appendix to Fox, p. 95. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il s'est
passé avant hier une chose de grande conséquence dans la chambre basse:
il fut proposé le matin que la chambre se mettoit en comité l'après diner
pour considérer la harangue du roy sur l'affaire de la religion, et savoir ce
qui devoit être entendu par le terme <i>de religion protestante</i>. La résolution
fut prise unanimement, et sans contradiction, de faire une adresse au roy
pour le prier de faire une proclamation pour l'exécution des loix contre
tous les nonconformistes généralement, c'est-à-dire, contre tous ceux qui
ne sont pas ouvertement de l'église Anglicane; cela enferme les presbitériens
et tous les sectaires, aussi bien que les catholiques Romains. La
malice de cette résolution fut aussitôt reconnu du roy d'Angleterre, et de
ses ministres; les principaux de la chambre basse furent mandés, et ceux
que sa majesté Britannique croit être dans ses intérêts; il leur fit une
réprimande sévère de s'être laissés séduire et entraîner à une résolution si
dangereuse et si peu admissible. Il leur déclara que, si l'on persistoit à
lui faire une pareille adresse, il répondroit à la chambre basse en termes
si décisifs et si fermes qu'on ne retourneroit pas à lui faire une pareille
adresse. La manière dont sa majesté Britannique s'explique produisit son
effet hier matin; et la chambre basse rejeta tout d'une voix ce que avoit
été résolu en comité le jour auparavant.</span>"</p>

<p class="footnote">The only man who behaved with distinguished spirit in this wretched
parliament was one in whose political life there is little else to praise, Sir
Edward Seymour. He opposed the grant of the revenues for life, and
spoke strongly against the illegal practices in the elections. Fox, 90, 93.</p>

 This opinion has been well supported by Mr. Serjeant Heywood
(<i>Vindication of Mr. Fox's History</i>, p. 154). In some few of Barillon's
letters to the King of France, he speaks of James's intention <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">établir la
religion catholique</span>; but these perhaps might be explained by a far greater
number of passages, where he says only établir le libre exercice de la
religion catholique, and by the general tenor of his correspondence. But
though the primary object was toleration, I have no doubt but that they
conceived this was to end in establishment. See what Barillon says (p. 84);
though the legal reasoning is false, as might be expected from a foreigner.
It must at all events be admitted that the conduct of the king after the
formation of the catholic junto in 1686, demonstrates an intention of
overthrowing the Anglican establishment.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84" href="#FNanchor_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a>
 "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il [le roy] me répondit à ce que je venois de dire, que je connoissois
le fond de ses intentions pour l'établissement de la religion catholique;
qu'il n'esperoit en venir à bout que par l'assistance de V. M.; que je
voyois qu'il venoit de donner des emplois dans ses troupes aux catholiques
aussi bien qu'aux protestans; que cette égalité fâchoit beaucoup de gens,
mais qu'il n'avoit pas laissé passer une occasion si importante sans s'en
prévaloir; qu'il feroit de même à l'égard des choses practicables, et que
je voyois plus clair sur cela dans ses desseins que ses propres ministres,
s'en étant souvent ouvert avec moi sans reserve.</span>"&mdash;P. 104. In a second
conversation immediately afterwards, the king repeated, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que je connoissois
le fond de ses desseins, et que je pouvois répondre que tout son
but étoit d'établir la religion catholique; qu'il ne perdroit aucune occasion
de la faire ... que peu à peu il va à son but, et que ce qu'il fait presentement
emporte nécessairement l'exercice libre de la religion catholique, qui
se trouvera établi avant qu'un acte de parlement l'autorise; que je connoissois
assez l'Angleterre pour savoir que la possibilité d'avoir des emplois
et des charges fera plus de catholiques que la permission de dire des messes
publiques; que cependant il s'attendoit que V. M. ne l'abandonneroit pas,"
etc. P. 106. Sunderland entered on the same subject, saying, "Je ne sais
pas si l'on voit en France les choses comme elles sont ici; mais je défie
ceux qui les voyent de près de ne pas connoître que le roy mon maître n'a
rien dans le c&oelig;ur si avant que l'envie d'établir la religion catholique; qu'il
ne peut même, selon le bon sens et la droite raison, avoir d'autre but; que
sans cela il ne sera jamais en sûreté, et sera toujours exposé au zèle indiscret
de ceux qui échaufferont les peuples contre la catholicité, tant qu'elle ne
sera pas <i>plus</i> pleinement établie; il y a une autre chose certaine, c'est que
ce plan là ne peut réussir que par un concert et une liaison étroite avec le
roi votre maître; c'est un projet qui ne peut convenir qu'à lui, ni réussir
que par lui. Toutes les autres puissances s'y opposeront ouvertement,
ou le traverseront sous main. On sait bien que cela ne convient point au
Prince d'Orange; mais s'il ne sera pas en état de l'empêcher si on veut
se conduire en France comme il est nécessaire, c'est-à-dire ménager l'amitié
du roy d'Angleterre, et le contenir dans son projet. Je vois clairement
l'appréhension que beaucoup de gens ont d'une liaison avec la France, et
les efforts qu'on fait pour l'affoiblir; mais cela ne sera au pouvoir de
personne, si on n'en a pas envie ce France; c'est sur quoi il faut que vous
vouz expliquiez nettement, que vous fassiez connoître que le roi votre
maître veut aider de bonne foi le roi d'Angleterre à établir fermement la
religion catholique.</span>"</p>

<p class="footnote">The word <i>plus</i> in the above passage is not in Dalrymple's extract from
this letter. Vol. ii. part ii. pp. 174, 187. Yet for omitting this word
Serjeant Heywood (not having attended to Dalrymple), censures Mr. Rose
as if it had been done purposely. <i>Vindic. of Fox</i>, p. 154. But this is not
quite judicious or equitable, since another critic might suggest that it
was purposely interpolated. No one of common candour would suspect
this of Mr. Fox; but his copyist, I presume, was not infallible. The word
<i>plus</i> is evidently incorrect. The catholic religion was not established at
all in any possible sense; what room could there be for the comparative?
M. Mazure, who has more lately perused the letters of Barillon at Paris,
prints the passage without <i>plus</i>. <i>Hist. de la Révol.</i> ii. 36. Certainly the
whole conversation here ascribed to Sunderland points at something far
beyond the free exercise of the Roman catholic religion.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a>
 It is curious to remark that both James and Louis considered the
re-establishment of the catholic religion and of the royal authority as
closely connected, and parts of one great system. Barillon in Fox,
Append. 19, 57; Mazure, i. 346. Mr. Fox maintains (<i>Hist.</i> p. 102) that
the great object of the former was absolute power rather than the interests
of popery. Doubtless if James had been a protestant, his encroachments
on the rights of his subjects would not have been less than they were,
though not exactly of the same nature; but the main object of his reign
can hardly be denied to have been either the full toleration, or the national
establishment of the church of Rome. Mr. Fox's remark must, at all
events, be limited to the year 1685.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a>
 Fox, Appendix, p. 33; Ralph, 869. The prosecution of Baxter for
what was called reflecting on the bishops, is an instance of this. <i>State
Trials</i>, ii. 494. Notwithstanding James's affected zeal for toleration, he
did not scruple to congratulate Louis on the success of his very different
mode of converting heretics. Yet I rather believe him to have been really
averse to persecution; though with true Stuart insincerity he chose to
flatter his patron. Dalrymple, p. 177. A book by Claude, published in
Holland, entitled <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Plaintes des Protestans cruellement opprimés dans le
royaume de France</span></i>, was ordered to be burned by the hangman, on the
complaint of the French ambassador, and the translator and printer
to be enquired after and prosecuted. <i>Lond. Gazette</i>, May 8, 1686. Jefferies
objected to this in council as unusual; but the king was determined to
gratify his most christian brother. Mazure, ii. 122. It is said also that
one of the reasons for the disgrace of Lord Halifax was his speaking warmly
about the revocation of the edict of Nantes. <i>Id.</i> p. 55. Yet James sometimes
blamed this himself, so as to displease Louis. <i>Id.</i> p. 56. In fact,
it very much tended to obstruct his own views for the establishment of a
religion which had just shown itself in so odious a form. For this reason,
though a brief was read in churches for the sufferers, special directions
were given that there should be no sermon. It is even said that he took
on himself the distribution of the money collected for the refugees, in order
to stop the subscription; or at least that his interference had that effect.
The enthusiasm for the French protestants was such that single persons
subscribed 500 or 1000 pounds; which, relatively to the opulence of the
kingdom, almost equals any munificence of this age. <i>Id.</i> p. 123.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_87" id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a>
 It is well known that the House of Commons, in 1685, would not pass
the bill for reversing Lord Stafford's attainder, against which a few peers
had entered a very spirited protest. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 1361. Barillon says, this
was "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parce que dans le préambule il y a des mots insérés qui semblent
favoriser la religion catholique; cela seul a retardé la rehabilitation du
Comte de Stafford dont tous sont d'accord à l'égard du fond.</span>" Fox, App.
p. 110. But there was another reason which might have weight. Stafford
had been convicted on the evidence, not only of Oates, who had been lately
found guilty of perjury, but of several other witnesses, especially Dugdale
and Turberville. And these men had been brought forward by the
government against Lord Shaftesbury and College, the latter of whom
had been hanged on their testimony. The reversal of Lord Stafford's
attainder, just as we now think it, would have been a disgrace to these
Crown prosecutions; and a conscientious tory would be loth to vote for it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a>
 "In all the disputes relating to that mystery before the civil wars,
the church of England protestant writers owned the real presence, and
only abstracted from the <i>modus</i> or manner of Christ's body being present
in the eucharist, and therefore durst not say but it might be there by
transubstantiation as well as by any other way.... It was only of
late years that such principles have crept into the church of England;
which, having been blown into the parliament house, had raised continual
tumults about religion ever since. Those unlearned and fanatical notions
were never heard of till Doctor Stillingfleet's late invention of them, by
which he exposed himself to the lash, not only of the Roman catholics,
but to that of many of the church of England controvertists too." <i>Life
of James</i>, ii. 146.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a>
 See <i>London Gazettes</i>, 1685, <i>passim</i>: the most remarkable are inserted
by Ralph and Kennet. I am sure the addresses which we have witnessed
in this age among a neighbouring people are not on the whole more fulsome
and disgraceful. Addresses, however, of all descriptions, as we well know,
are generally the composition of some zealous individual, whose expressions
are not to be taken as entirely those of the subscribers. Still these
are sufficient to manifest the general spirit of the times.</p>

<p class="footnote">The king's popularity at his accession, which all contemporary writers
attest, is strongly expressed by Lord Lonsdale. "The great interest he
had in his brother, so that all applications to the king seemed to succeed
only as he favoured them, and the general opinion of him to be a prince
steady above all others to his word, made him at that time the most
popular prince that had been known in England for a long time. And
from men's attempting to exclude him, they, at this juncture of time,
made him their darling; no more was his religion terrible; his magnanimous
courage, and the hardships he had undergone, were the discourse of
all men. And some reports of a misunderstanding betwixt the French
king and him, occasioned originally by the marriage of the Lady Mary to
the Prince of Orange, industriously spread abroad to amuse the ignorant,
put men in hopes of what they had long wished; that, by a conjunction
of Holland and Spain, etc., we might have been able to reduce France
to the terms of the Pyrenean treaty, which was now become the terror
of Christendom, we never having had a prince for many ages that had so
great a reputation for experience and a martial spirit."&mdash;P. 3. This last
sentence is a truly amusing contrast to the real truth; James having been,
in his brother's reign, the most obsequious and unhesitating servant of the
French king.</p>

in future on the assistance of France. Fox's App. 59, 60; Mazure, i. 432.
But this was prevented, partly by the sudden invasion of Monmouth,
which made a new session necessary, and gave hopes of a large supply for
the army; and partly by the unwillingness of the King of France to
advance as much money as the English government wanted. In fact, the
plan of continual prorogations answered as well.</p>

is mis-printed, as the court and country parties were very equal. It is
said in this manuscript, that those who opposed the address, opposed also

 Henry Earl of Clarendon's papers, ii. 278. In Gutch's <i>Collectanea
Curiosa</i>, vol. i. p. 287, we find not only this license to Massey, but one to
Obadiah Walker, master of University College, and to two fellows of the
same, and one of Brazen-nose College, to absent themselves from church,
and not to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, or do any other
thing to which, by the laws and statutes of the realm, or those of the
college, they are obliged. There is also, in the same book, a dispensation
for one Sclater, curate of Putney, and rector of Esher, from using the
common prayer, etc., etc. <i>Id.</i> p. 290. These are in May 1686, and subscribed
by Powis, the solicitor-general. The attorney-general, Sawyer,
had refused; as we learn from Reresby, p. 133, the only contemporary
writer, perhaps, who mentions this very remarkable aggression on the
established church.</p>

 The catholic lords, according to Barillon, had represented to the king,
that nothing could be done with parliament so long as the treasurer
caballed against the designs of his majesty. James promised to dismiss
him if he did not change his religion. Mazure, ii. 170. The queen had
previously been rendered his enemy by the arts of Sunderland, who
persuaded her that Lord and Lady Rochester had favoured the king's
intimacy with the Countess of Dorchester in order to thwart the popish
intrigue. <i>Id.</i> 149. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On voit,</span>" says Barillon, on the treasurer's dismissal,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que la cabale catholique a entièrement prevalu. On s'attendoit depuis
quelque temps à ce qui est arrivé au comte de Rochester; mais l'exécution
fait encore une nouvelle impression sur les esprits.</span>"&mdash;P. 181.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_103" id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a>
 <i>Life of James</i>, 74. Barillon frequently mentions this cabal, as having
in effect the whole conduct of affairs in their hands. Sunderland belonged
to them; but Jefferies, being reckoned on the protestant side, had, I
believe, very little influence for at least the two latter years of the king's
reign. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les affaires de ce pays-ci," says Bonrepos, in 1686, "ne roulent
à présent que sur la religion. Le roi est absolument gouverné par les
catholiques. My Lord Sunderland ne se maintient que par ceux-ci, et par
son dévouement à faire tout ce qu'il croit être agréable sur ce point. Il a
le secret des affaires de Rome.</span>" Mazure, ii. 124. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On feroit ici,</span>" says
Barillon, the same year, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce que on fait en France</span>" [that is, I suppose,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dragonner et fusilier les hérétiques</span>] "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si l'on pouvoit espérer de réussir.</span>"&mdash;P.
127.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_104" id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a>
 Rochester makes so very bad a figure in all Barillon's correspondence,
that there really seems no want of candour in this supposition. He was
evidently the most active co-operator in the connection of both the
brothers with France, and seems to have had as few compunctious visitings,
where the church of England was not concerned, as Sunderland himself.
Godolphin was too much implicated, at least by acquiescence, in the
counsels of this reign; yet we find him suspected of not wishing "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">se passer
entièrement de parlement, et à rompre nettement avec le prince d'Orange.</span>"
Fox, Append, p. 60.</p>

<p class="footnote">If Rochester had gone over to the Romanists, many, probably, would
have followed: on the other hand, his steadiness retained the wavering.
It was one of the first great disappointments with which the king met.
But his dismissal from the treasury created a sensible alarm. Dalrymple,
179.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_105" id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a>
 Lord Dartmouth wrote to say that Fletcher told him there were good
grounds to suspect that the prince, underhand, encouraged the expedition,
with design to ruin the Duke of Monmouth; and this Dalrymple believes.
P. 136. It is needless to observe, that such subtle and hazardous policy
was totally out of William's character; nor is there much more reason to
believe what is insinuated by James himself (Macpherson's <i>Extracts</i>, p. 144;
<i>Life of James</i>, ii. 34), that Sunderland had been in secret correspondence
with Monmouth; unless indeed it were, as seems hinted in the latter work,
with the king's knowledge.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_106" id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a>
 The number of persons who suffered the sentence of the law, in the
famous western assize of Jefferies, has been differently stated; but
according to a list in the Harleian Collection, n. 4689, it appears to be as
follows: at Winchester, one (Mrs. Lisle) executed; at Salisbury, none; at
Dorchester, 74 executed, 171 transported; at Exeter, 14 executed,
7 transported; at Taunton, 144 executed, 284 transported; at Wells, 97
executed, 393 transported. In all, 330 executed, 855 transported; besides
many that were left in custody for want of evidence. It may be observed,
that the prisoners sentenced to transportation appear to have been made
over to some gentlemen of interest at court; among others, to Sir Christopher
Musgrave, who did not blush to beg the grant of their unfortunate
countrymen, to be sold as slaves in the colonies.</p>

<p class="footnote">The apologists of James II. have endeavoured to lay the entire blame
of these cruelties on Jefferies, and to represent the king as ignorant of them.
Roger North tells a story of his brother's interference, which is plainly
contradicted by known dates, and the falsehood of which throws just
suspicion on his numerous anecdotes. See <i>State Trials</i>, xi. 303. But the
king speaks with apparent approbation of what he calls Jefferies's campaign,
in writing to the Prince of Orange (Dalrymple, 165); and I have
heard that there are extant additional proofs of his perfect acquaintance
with the details of those assizes; nor, indeed, can he be supposed ignorant
of them. Jefferies himself, before his death, declared that he had not
been half bloody enough for him by whom he was employed. Burnet, 651
(note to Oxford edition, vol. iii.). The king, or his biographer in his behalf,
makes a very awkward apology for the execution of Major Holmes, which
is shown by himself to have been a gross breach of faith. <i>Life of James</i>,
ii. 43.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is unnecessary to dwell on what may be found in every history: the
trials of Mrs. Lisle, Mrs. Gaunt, and Alderman Cornish; the former before
Jefferies, the two latter before Jones, his successor as chief justice of K. B.,
a judge nearly as infamous as the former, though not altogether so brutal.
Both Mrs. Lisle's and Cornish's convictions were without evidence, and
consequently were reversed after the revolution. <i>State Trials</i>, vol. xi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_107" id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107"><span class="label">[107]</span></a>
 Several proofs of this appear in the correspondence of Barillon. Fox,
135; Mazure, ii. 22. The nuncio, M. d'Adda, was a moderate man, and
united with the moderate catholic peers, Bellasis, Arundel, and Powis.
<i>Id.</i> 127. This party urged the king to keep on good terms with the Prince
of Orange, and to give way about the test. <i>Id.</i> 184, 255. They were
disgusted at Father Petre's introduction into the privy council; 308, 353.
But it has ever been the misfortune of that respectable body to suffer
unjustly for the follies of a few. Barillon admits, very early in James's
reign, that many of them disliked the arbitrary proceedings of the court;
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ils prétendent être bons Anglois, c'est-à-dire, ne pas désirer que le roi
d'Angleterre ôte à la nation ses privilèges et ses libertés.</span>" Mazure, i. 404.</p>

<p class="footnote">William openly declared his willingness to concur in taking off the penal
laws, provided the test might remain. Burnet, 694; Dalrymple, 184;
Mazure, ii. 216, 250, 346. James replied that he must have all or nothing.
<i>Id.</i> 353.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_108" id="Footnote_108" href="#FNanchor_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a>
 I do not know that this intrigue has been brought to light before the
recent valuable publication of M. Mazure, certainly not with such full
evidence. See i. 417; ii. 128, 160, 165, 167, 182, 188, 192. Barillon says
to his master in one place: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est une matière fort délicate à traiter. Je
sais pourtant qu'on en parle au roi d'Angleterre; et qu'avec le temps on
ne désespère pas de trouver des moyens pour faire passer la couronne sur
la tête d'un heritier catholique. Il faut pour cela venir à bout de beaucoup
des choses qui ne sont encore que commencées.</span>"</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_110" id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a>
 The correspondence began by an affectedly obscure letter of Lady
Sunderland to the Prince of Orange, dated March 7, 1687. Dalrymple,
187. The meaning, however, cannot be misunderstood. Sunderland
himself sent a short letter of compliment by Dykvelt, May 28, referring to
what that envoy had to communicate. Churchill, Nottingham, Rochester,
Devonshire, and others, wrote also by Dykvelt. Halifax was in correspondence
at the end of 1686.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_111" id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a>
 Sunderland does not appear, by the extracts from Barillon's letters
published by M. Mazure, to have been the adviser of the king's most
injudicious measures. He was united with the queen, who had more
moderation than her husband. It is said by Barillon that both he and
Petre were against the prosecution of the bishops, ii. 448. The king
himself ascribes this step to Jefferies, and seems to glance also at Sunderland
as its adviser. <i>Life of James</i>, ii. 156. He speaks more explicitly as to
Jefferies in Macpherson's <i>Extracts</i>, 151. Yet Lord Clarendon's <i>Diary</i>,
ii. 49, tends to acquit Jefferies. Probably the king had nobody to blame
but himself. One cause of Sunderland's continuance in the apparent
support of a policy which he knew to be destructive was his poverty. He
was in the pay of France, and even importunate for its money. Mazure,
372; Dalrymple, 270 <i>et post</i>. Louis only gave him half what he demanded.
Without the blindest submission to the king, he was every moment falling;
and this drove him in to a step as injudicious as it was unprincipled, his
pretended change of religion, which was not publicly made till June 1688,
though he had been privately reconciled, it is said (Mazure, ii. 463) more
than a year before by Father Petre.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a>
 "This defection of those his majesty had hitherto put the greatest
confidence in [Clarendon and Rochester], and the sullen disposition of the
church of England party in general, made him think it necessary to
reconcile another; and yet he hoped to do it in such a manner as not to
disgust quite the church-man neither." <i>Life of James</i>, ii. 102.</p>

addresses grew more ardent after the queen's pregnancy became known.
They were renewed of course, after the birth of the Prince of Wales. But
scarce any appear after the expected invasion was announced. The Tories
(to whom add the dissenters) seem to have thrown off the mask at once,
and deserted the king whom they had so grossly flattered, as instantaneously
as parasites on the stage desert their patron on the first tidings of his ruin.</p>

<p class="footnote">The dissenters have been a little ashamed of their compliance with the
declaration, and of their silence in the popish controversy during this
reign. Neal, 755, 768; and see <i>Biogr. Brit.</i> art. Alsop. The best excuses
are, that they had been so harassed that it was not in human nature to
refuse a mitigation of suffering on almost any terms; that they were by
no means unanimous in their transitory support of the court; and that
they gladly embraced the first offers of an equal indulgence held out to
them by the church.</p>

 "The king now finding that nothing which had the least appearance

down with the people, unless it had the parliamentary stamp on it, resolved
to try if he could get the penal laws and test taken off by that authority."

neither the king nor Lord Sunderland wished to convoke a parliament,
which was pressed forward by the eager catholics, ii. 399.</p>

 It seems, however, confirmed by Mazure, ii. 390, with the addition,
that Petre, like a second Wolsey, aspired also to be chancellor. The pope,
however, would not make him a bishop, against the rules of the order of

 "Above twenty years together," says Sir Roger L'Estrange, perhaps
himself a disguised catholic, in his reply to the reasons of the clergy of
the diocese of Oxford against petitioning (<i>Somers Tracts</i>, viii. 45), "without
any regard to the nobility, gentry, and commonalty, our clergy have been
publishing to the world that the king can do greater things than are done
in his declaration; but now the scene is altered, and they are become more
concerned to maintain their reputation even with the commonalty than
with the king." See also in the same volume, p. 19. "A remonstrance
from the church of England to both houses of parliament," 1685; and

 Several proofs of this occur in the course of M. Mazure's work. When
the Dutch ambassador, Van Citers, showed him a paper, probably forged
to exasperate him, but purporting to be written by some catholics, wherein
it was said that it would be better for the people to be vassals of France
than slaves of the devil, he burst out into rage. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jamais! non, jamais!
je ne ferai rien qui me puisse mettre au dessous des rois de France et
d'Espagne. Vassal, vassal de la France!" s'écria-t-il avec emportement.
"Monsieur! si le parlement avoit voulu, s'il vouloit encore, j'aurois porté,
je porterois encore la monarchie a un de considération qu'elle n'a jamais
eu sous aucune des rois mes prédécesseurs, et votre état y trouveroit
peut-être sa propre sécurité.</span>'" Vol. ii. 165. Sunderland said to Barillon,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le roi d'Angleterre se reproche de ne pas être en Europe tout ce qu'il
devoit être; et souvent il se plaint que le roi votre maître n'a pas pour lui
assez de considération.</span>" <i>Id.</i> 313. On the other hand, Louis was much
mortified that James made so few applications for his aid. His hope seems
to have been that by means of French troops, or troops at least in his pay,
he should get a footing in England; and this was what the other was too
proud and jealous to permit. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comme le roi,</span>" he said, in 1687, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne
doute pas de mon affection et du désir que j'ai de voir la religion catholique
bien établie en Angleterre, il faut croire qu'il se trouve assez de force et
d'autorité pour exécuter ses desseins, puis-qu'il n'a pas recours à moi.</span>"&mdash;P. 258;

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_132" id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a>
 James affected the same ceremonial as the King of France, and received
the latter's ambassador sitting and covered. Louis only said, smiling,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le roi mon frère est fier, mais il aime assez les pistoles de France.</span>"
Mazure, i. 423. A more extraordinary trait of James's pride is mentioned
by Dangeau, whom I quote from the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, xix. 470. After
his retirement to St. Germains, he wore violets in court mourning; which,
by etiquette, was confined to the kings of France. The courtiers were a
little astonished to see <i>solem geminum</i>, though not at a loss where to
worship. Louis, of course, had too much magnanimity to express resentment.
But what a picture of littleness of spirit does this exhibit in a
wretched pauper, who could only escape by the most contemptible insignificance
the charge of most ungrateful insolence!</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_133" id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a>
 Mazure, iii. 50. James was so much out of humour at D'Avaux's
interference, that he asked his confidents, "if the King of France thought
he could treat him like the cardinal of Furstenburg," a creature of Louis
XIV. whom he had set up for the electorate of Cologne. <i>Id.</i> 69. He was
in short so much displeased with his own ambassador at the Hague,
Skelton, for giving into his declaration of D'Avaux, that he not only recalled
but sent him to the Tower. Burnet is therefore mistaken (p. 768) in
believing that there was actually an alliance, though it was very natural
that he should give credit to what an ambassador asserted in a matter
of such importance. In fact, a treaty was signed between James and
Louis, Sept. 13, by which some French ships were to be under the former's
orders. Mazure, iii. 67.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_134" id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a>
 Louis continued to find money, though despising James and disgusted
with him, probably with a view to his own grand interests. He should,
nevertheless, have declared war against Holland in October, which must
have put a stop to the armament. But he had discovered that James
with extreme meanness had privately offered, about the end of September,
to join the alliance against him as the only resource. This wretched
action is first brought to light by M. Mazure, iii. 104. He excused himself
to the King of France by an assurance that he was not acting sincerely
towards Holland. Louis, though he gave up his intention of declaring
war, behaved with great magnanimity and compassion towards the falling
bigot.</p>

who had hitherto done as much as in their station they well could to ruin
the king's cause and paralyse his arms. Several modern writers have
endeavoured to throw an interest about James at the moment of his fall,
either from a lurking predilection for all legitimately crowned heads, or
from a notion that it becomes a generous historian to excite compassion
for the unfortunate. There can be no objection to pitying James, if this
feeling is kept unmingled with any blame of those who were the instruments
of this misfortune. It was highly expedient for the good of this
country, because the revolution settlement could not otherwise be attained,
to work on James's sense of his deserted state by intimidation; and for that
purpose the order conveyed by three of his own subjects, perhaps with
some rudeness of manner, to leave Whitehall was necessary. The drift of
several accounts of the revolution that may be read is to hold forth
Mulgrave, Craven, Arran, and Dundee to admiration, at the expense of
William and of those who achieved the great consolidation of English
liberty.</p>

 <i>Parl. Hist.</i> v. 26. The former address on the king's first quitting
London, signed by the peers and bishops, who met at Guildhall, Dec. 11,
did not, in express terms, desire the Prince of Orange to assume the
government, or to call a parliament, though it evidently tended to that
result, censuring the king and extolling the prince's conduct. <i>Id.</i> 19. It
was signed by the archbishop, his last public act. Burnet has exposed
himself to the lash of Ralph by stating this address of Dec. 11 incorrectly.</p>

 Somerville and several other writers have not accurately stated the
question; and suppose the Lords to have debated whether the throne,
on the hypothesis of its vacancy, should be filled by a king or a regent.
Such a mode of putting the question would have been absurd. I observe
that M. Mazure has been deceived by these authorities.</p>

 This was carried by sixty-two to forty-seven, according to Lord
Clarendon; several of the tories going over, and others who had been
hitherto absent coming down to vote. Forty peers protested, including
twelve bishops, out of seventeen present. Trelawney, who had voted
against the regency, was one of them; but not Compton, Lloyd of St.
Asaph, Crewe, Sprat, or Hall; the three former, I believe, being in the
majority. Lloyd had been absent when the vote passed against a regency,
out of unwillingness to disagree with the majority of his brethren; but he
was entirely of Burnet's mind. The votes of the bishops are not accurately
stated in most books; which has induced me to mention them here.

 See Burnet's remarkable conversation with Bentinck, wherein the
former warmly opposed the settlement of the crown on the Prince of
Orange alone, as Halifax had suggested. But nothing in it is more
remarkable than that the bishop does not perceive that this was virtually
done; for it would be difficult to prove that Mary's royalty differed at all
from that of a queen consort, except in having her name in the style. She
was exactly in the same predicament as Philip had been during his marriage
with Mary I. Her admirable temper made her acquiesce in this exclusion
from power, which the sterner character of her husband demanded; and
with respect to the conduct of the convention, it must be observed that
the nation owed her no particular debt of gratitude, nor had she any better
claim than her sister to fill a throne by election, which had been declared
vacant. In fact, there was no middle course between what was done, and
following the precedent of Philip, as to which Bentinck said, he fancied the
Prince would not like to be his wife's gentleman usher; for a divided
sovereignty was a monstrous and impracticable expedient in theory,
however the submissive disposition of the queen might have prevented its
mischiefs. Burnet seems to have had a puzzled view of this; for he says
afterwards, "it seemed to be a double-bottomed monarchy, where there
were two joint sovereigns; but those who know the queen's temper and
principles had no apprehensions of divided counsels, or of a distracted
government." Vol. ii. 2. The convention had not trusted to the queen's
temper and principles. It required a distinct act of parliament (2 W. and
M. c. 6) to enable her to exercise the regal power during the king's absence
from England.</p>

 The guards retained out of the old army disbanded at the king's return,
have been already mentioned to have amounted to about 5000 men;
though some assert their number at first to have been considerably less.
No objection seems to have been made at the time to the continuance of
these regiments. But in 1667, on the insult offered to the coasts by the
Dutch fleet, a great panic arising, 12,000 fresh troops were hastily levied.
The Commons, on July 25, came to an unanimous resolution, that his
majesty be humbly desired by such members as are his privy council, that
when a peace is concluded, the new-raised forces be disbanded. The king,
four days after, in a speech to both houses, said, "he wondered what one
thing he had done since his coming into England, to persuade any sober
person that he did intend to govern by a standing army; he said he was
more an Englishman than to do so. He desired, for as much as concerned
him, to preserve the laws," etc. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> iv. 363. Next session the two
houses thanked him for having disbanded the late raised forces. <i>Id.</i> 369.
But in 1673, during the second Dutch war, a considerable force having
been levied, the House of Commons, after a warm debate, resolved (Nov. 3)
that a standing army was a grievance. <i>Id.</i> 604. And on February following,
that the continuing of any standing forces in this nation, other than
the militia, is a great grievance and vexation to the people; and that this
house do humbly petition his majesty to cause immediately to be disbanded
that part of them that were raised since Jan. 1, 1663. <i>Id.</i> 665. This was
done not long afterwards; but early in 1678, on the pretext of entering
into a war with France, he suddenly raised an army of 20,000 men or more,
according to some accounts, which gave so much alarm to the parliament,
that they would only vote supplies on condition that these troops should
be immediately disbanded. <i>Id.</i> 985. The king, however, employed the
money without doing so; and maintained, in the next session, that it had
been necessary to keep them on foot; intimating at the same time, that he
was now willing to comply, if the house thought it expedient to disband
the troops; which they accordingly voted, with unanimity, to be necessary
for the safety of his majesty's person, and preservation of the peace of
the government. Nov. 25. <i>Id.</i> 1049. James showed, in his speech to
parliament (Nov. 9, 1685) that he intended to keep on foot a standing army.
<i>Id.</i> 1371. But, though that House of Commons was very differently
composed from those in his brother's reign, and voted as large a supply
as the king required, they resolved that a bill be brought in to render the
militia more useful; an oblique and timid hint of their disapprobation of
a regular force, against which several members had spoken.</p>

<p class="footnote">I do not find that any one, even in debate, goes the length of denying
that the king might, by his prerogative, maintain a regular army; none
at least of the resolutions in the Commons can be said to have that effect.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_158" id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a>
 It is expressly against the petition of right, to quarter troops on the
citizens, or to inflict any punishment by martial law. No court martial,
in fact, can have any coercive jurisdiction except by statute; unless we
should resort to the old tribunal of the constable and marshal. And that
this was admitted, even in bad times, we may learn by an odd case in Sir
Thomas Jones's <i>Reports</i>, 147 (Pasch. 33 Car. 2, 1681). An action was
brought for assault and false imprisonment. The defendant pleaded that
he was lieutenant-governor of the isle of Scilly, and that the plaintiff was
a soldier belonging to the garrison, and that it was the ancient custom of
the castle, that if any soldier refused to render obedience, the governor
might punish him by imprisonment for a reasonable time; which he had
therefore done. The plaintiff demurred, and had judgment in his favour.
By demurring, he put it to the court to determine, whether this plea,
which is obviously fabricated in order to cover the want of any general
right to maintain discipline in this manner, were valid in point of law;
which they decided, as it appears, in the negative.</p>

<p class="footnote">In the next reign, however, an attempt was made to punish deserters
capitally, not by a court martial, but on the authority of an ancient act of
parliament. Chief-Justice Herbert is said to have resigned his place in
the King's Bench rather than come into this. Wright succeeded him;
and two deserters, having been convicted, were executed in London.
Ralph, 961. I cannot discover that there was anything illegal in the
proceeding; and therefore question a little Herbert's motive. See
3 Inst. 96.</p>

 See several in the <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. x. One of these, a "Letter to
a Member of the Convention," by Dr. Sherlock, is very ably written: and
puts all the consequences of a change of government, as to popular dissatisfaction,
etc., much as they turned out, though, of course, failing to
show that a treaty with the king would be less open to objection. Sherlock
declined for a time to take the oaths; but, complying afterwards, and
writing in vindication, or at least excuse, of the revolution, incurred the
hostility of the Jacobites, and impaired his own reputation by so interested
a want of consistency; for he had been the most eminent champion of
passive obedience. Even the distinction he found out, of the lawfulness
of allegiance to a king <i>de facto</i>, was contrary to his former doctrine.</p>

 The necessity of excluding men so conscientious, and several of whom
had very recently sustained so conspicuously the brunt of the battle against
King James, was very painful; and motives of policy, as well as generosity,
were not wanting in favour of some indulgence towards them. On the
other hand, it was dangerous to admit such a reflection on the new settlement,
as would be cast by its enemies, if the clergy, especially the bishops,
should be excused from the oath of allegiance. The House of Lords
made an amendment in the act requiring this oath, dispensing with it in
the case of ecclesiastical persons, unless they should be called upon by the
privy-council. This, it was thought, would furnish a security for their
peaceable demeanour, without shocking the people and occasioning a dangerous
schism. But the Commons resolutely opposed this amendment,
as an unfair distinction, and derogatory to the king's title. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 218;
Lords' Journals, 17 April 1689. The clergy, however, had six months more
time allowed them, in order to take the oath, than the possessors of lay
offices.</p>

<p class="footnote">Upon the whole, I think the reasons for deprivation greatly preponderated.
Public prayers for the king by name form part of our liturgy;
and it was surely impossible to dispense with the clergy's reading them,
which was as obnoxious as the oath of allegiance. Thus the beneficed
priests must have been excluded; and it was hardly required to make an
exception for the sake of a few bishops, even if difficulties of the same kind
would not have occurred in the exercise of their jurisdiction, which hangs
upon, and has a perpetual reference to, the supremacy of the Crown.</p>

<p class="footnote">The king was empowered to reserve a third part of the value of their
benefices to any twelve of the recusant clergy. 1 W. &amp; M. c. 8, s. 16.
But this could only be done at the expense of their successors; and the
behaviour of the nonjurors, who strained every nerve in favour of the
dethroned king, did not recommend them to the government. The
deprived bishops, though many of them through their late behaviour were
deservedly esteemed, cannot be reckoned among the eminent characters of
our church for learning or capacity. Sancroft, the most distinguished of
them, had not made any remarkable figure; and none of the rest had any
pretensions to literary credit. Those who filled their places were incomparably
superior. Among the non-juring clergy a certain number were
considerable men; but, upon the whole, the well-affected part of the
church, not only at the revolution, but for fifty years afterwards, contained
by far its most useful and able members. Yet the effect of this expulsion
was highly unfavourable to the new government; and it required all the
influence of a latitudinarian school of divinity, led by Locke, which was
very strong among the laity under William, to counteract it.</p>

 The parliamentary debates are full of complaints as to the mismanagement
of all things in Ireland. These might be thought hasty or factious;
but Marshal Schomberg's letters to the king yield them strong confirmation.
Dalrymple, Appendix, 26, etc. William's resolution to take the Irish war
on himself saved not only that country but England. Our own constitution
was won on the Boyne. The star of the house of Stuart grew pale for
ever on that illustrious day, when James displayed again the pusillanimity
which had cost him his English crown. Yet the best friends of William
dissuaded him from going into Ireland, so imminent did the peril appear
at home. Dalrymple, <i>Id.</i> 97. "Things," says Burnet, "were in a very
ill disposition towards a fatal turn."</p>

 See the debates on this subject in the <i>Parliamentary History</i>, which is
a transcript from Anchitel Grey. The whigs, or at least some hot-headed
men among them, were certainly too much actuated by a vindictive spirit,

 The prominent instance of Sawyer's delinquency, which caused his
expulsion, was his refusal of a writ of error to Sir Thomas Armstrong.
<i>Parl. Hist.</i> 516. It was notorious that Armstrong suffered by a legal
murder; and an attorney-general in such a case could not be reckoned as
free from personal responsibility as an ordinary advocate who maintains
a cause for his fee. The first resolution had been to give reparation out of
the estates of the judges and prosecutors to Armstrong's family; which
was, perhaps rightly, abandoned.</p>

<p class="footnote">The House of Lords, who, having a power to examine upon oath, are
supposed to sift the truth in such enquiries better than the Commons, were
not remiss in endeavouring to bring the instruments of Stuart tyranny to
justice. Besides the committee appointed on the very second day of the
convention, 23 Jan. 1689, to investigate the supposed circumstances of
suspicion as to the death of Lord Essex (a committee renewed afterwards,
and formed of persons by no means likely to have abandoned any path
that might lead to the detection of guilt in the late king), another was
appointed in the second session of the same parliament (Lords' Journals,
2nd Nov. 1689) "to consider who were the advisers and prosecutors of the
<i>murders</i> of Lord Russell, Col. Sidney, Armstrong, Cornish, etc., and who
were the advisers of issuing out writs of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warrantos</span></i> against corporations,
and who were their regulators, and also who were the public assertors of
the dispensing power." The examinations taken before this committee
are printed in the Lords' Journals, 20th Dec. 1699; and there certainly
does not appear any want of zeal to convict the guilty. But neither the
law nor the proofs would serve them. They could establish nothing
against Dudley North, the tory sheriff of 1683, except that he had named
Lord Russell's panel himself; which, though irregular and doubtless
ill-designed, had unluckily a precedent in the conduct of the famous whig
sheriff, Slingsby Bethell; a man who, like North, though on the opposite
side, cared more for his party than for decency and justice. Lord Halifax
was a good deal hurt in character by this report; and never made a considerable
figure afterwards. Burnet, 34. His mortification led him to
engage in an intrigue with the late king, which was discovered; yet, I
suspect that, with his usual versatility, he again abandoned that cause
before his death. Ralph, 467. The act of grace (2 W. &amp; M. c. 10) contained
a small number of exceptions, too many indeed for its name; but
probably there would have been difficulty in prevailing on the houses to
pass it generally; and no one was ever molested afterwards on account of
his conduct before the revolution.</p>

persuade the house that the revenue having been granted to James for his
life, devolved to William during the natural life of the former; a technical
subtlety against the spirit of the grant. Somers seems not to have come
into this; but it is hard to collect the sense of speeches from Grey's
memoranda. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 139. It is not to be understood that the tories
universally were in favour of a grant for life, and the whigs against it.
But as the latter were the majority, it was in their power, speaking of
them as a party, to have carried the measure.</p>

in the new parliament, the tories, except Seymour, were for settling the
revenue during the king's life; but many whigs spoke on the other side.

 The sudden dissolution of this parliament cost him the hearts of those
who had made him king. Besides several temporary writings, especially
the "Impartial Inquiry" of the Earl of Warrington, an honest and intrepid
whig (Ralph, ii. 188), we have a letter from Mr. Wharton (afterwards
Marquis of Wharton) to the king, in Dalrymple, Appendix, p. 80, on the
change in his councils at this time, written in a strain of bold and bitter
expostulation, especially on the score of his employing those who had been
the servants of the late family, alluding probably to Godolphin, who was
indeed open to much exception. "I wish," says Lord Shrewsbury in the
same year, "you could have established your party upon the moderate
and honest-principled men of both factions; but, as there be a necessity of
declaring, I shall make no difficulty to own my sense that your majesty
and the government are much more safe depending upon the whigs, whose
designs, if any against, are improbable, and remoter, than with the tories,
who many of them, questionless, would bring in King James; and the very
best of them, I doubt, have a regency still in their heads; for, though I
agree them to be the properest instruments to carry the prerogative high,
yet I fear they have so unreasonable a veneration for monarchy, as not
altogether to approve the foundation yours is built upon." Shrewsbury

 <i>Parl. Hist</i>. 575; Ralph, 194; Burnet, 41. Two remarkable protests
were entered on the journals of the Lords on occasion of this bill; one by
the whigs, who were outnumbered on a particular division, and another
by the tories on the passing of the bill. They are both vehemently
expressed, and are among the not very numerous instances wherein the
original whig and tory principles have been opposed to each other. The
tory protest was expunged by order of the house. It is signed by eleven
peers and six bishops, among whom were Stillingfleet and Lloyd. The
whig protest has but ten signatures. The convention had already passed
an act for preventing doubts concerning their own authority (1 W. &amp; M.
stat. 1, c. 1), which could of course have no more validity than they were
able to give it. This bill had been much opposed by the tories. <i>Parl.
Hist.</i> v. 122.</p>

<p class="footnote">In order to make this clearer, it should be observed that the convention
which restored Charles II. not having been summoned by his writ, was
not reckoned by some royalist lawyers capable of passing valid acts; and
consequently all the statutes enacted by it were confirmed by the authority
of the next. Clarendon lays it down as undeniable that such confirmation
was necessary. Nevertheless, this objection having been made in the
court of King's Bench to one of their acts, the judges would not admit it
to be disputed; and said, that the act being made by King, Lords, and
Commons, they ought not now to pry into any defects of the circumstances
of calling them together, neither would they suffer a point to be stirred,
wherein the estates of so many were concerned. Heath <i>v.</i> Pryn, 1 Ventris,

 Some English subjects took James's commission, and fitted out
privateers which attacked our ships. They were taken, and it was
resolved to try them as pirates; when Dr. Oldys, the king's advocate, had
the assurance to object that this could not be done, as if James had still
the prerogatives of a sovereign prince by the law of nations. He was of

 The name of Carmarthen is perpetually mentioned among those whom
the late king reckoned his friends. Macpherson's <i>Papers</i>, i. 457, etc. Yet
this conduct was so evidently against his interest that we may perhaps
believe him insincere. William was certainly well aware that an extensive
conspiracy had been formed against his throne. It was of great importance
to learn the persons involved in it and their schemes. May we
not presume that Lord Carmarthen's return to his ancient allegiance was
feigned, in order to get an insight into the secrets of that party? This has
already been conjectured by Somerville (p. 395) of Lord Sunderland, who
is also implicated by Macpherson's publication, and doubtless with higher
probability; for Sunderland, always a favourite of William, could not
without insanity have plotted the restoration of a prince he was supposed
to have betrayed. It is evident that William was perfectly master of the
cabals of St. Germain's. That little court knew it was betrayed; and the
suspicion fell on Lord Godolphin. Dalrymple, 189. But I think Sunderland
and Carmarthen more likely.</p>

<p class="footnote">I should be inclined to suspect that by some of this double treachery the
secret of Princess Anne's repentant letter to her father reached William's
ears. She had come readily, or at least without opposition, into that part
of the settlement which postponed her succession after the death of Mary,
for the remainder of the king's life. It would indeed have been absurd to
expect that William was to descend from his throne in her favour; and
her opposition could not have been of much avail. But, when the civil
list and revenue came to be settled, the tories made a violent effort to
secure an income of £70,000 a year to her and her husband. <i>Parl. Hist.</i>
492. As this on one hand seemed beyond all fair proportion to the income
of the Crown, so the whigs were hardly less unreasonable in contending
that she should depend altogether on the king's generosity; especially as
by letters patent in the late reign, which they affected to call in question,
she had a revenue of about £30,000. In the end, the house resolved to
address the king, that he would make the princess's income £50,000 in the
whole. This, however, left an irreconcilable enmity, which the artifices of
Marlborough and his wife were employed to aggravate. They were accustomed,
in the younger sister's little court, to speak of the queen with
severity, and of the king with rude and odious epithets. Marlborough,
however, went much farther. He brought that narrow and foolish woman
into his own dark intrigues with St. Germain's. She wrote to her father,
whom she had grossly, and almost openly, charged with imposing a
spurious child as Prince of Wales, supplicating his forgiveness, and professing
repentance for the part she had taken. <i>Life of James</i>, 476;
Macpherson's <i>Papers</i>, i. 241.</p>

<p class="footnote">If this letter, as cannot seem improbable, became known to William,
we shall have a more satisfactory explanation of the queen's invincible
resentment toward her sister than can be found in any other part of their
history. Mary refused to see the princess on her death-bed; which shows
more bitterness than suited her mild and religious temper, if we look only
to the public squabbles about the Churchills as its motive. Burnet,
90; <i>Conduct of Duchess of Marlborough</i>, 41. But the queen must have
deeply felt the unhappy, though necessary, state of enmity in which
she was placed towards her father. She had borne a part in a great
and glorious enterprise, obedient to a woman's highest duty; and had
admirably performed those of the station to which she was called;
but still with some violation of natural sentiments, and some liability
to the reproach of those who do not fairly estimate the circumstances of
her situation:</p>

<p class="footnote center"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Infelix! utcunque ferant ea facta minores.</span></p>

<p class="footnote">Her sister, who had voluntarily trod the same path, who had misled her
into belief of her brother's illegitimacy, had now, from no real sense of
duty, but out of pique and weak compliance with cunning favourites,
solicited in a clandestine manner the late king's pardon, while his malediction
resounded in the ears of the queen. This feebleness and duplicity
made a sisterly friendship impossible.</p>

<p class="footnote">As for Lord Marlborough, he was among the first, if we except some
Scots renegades, who abandoned the cause of the revolution. He had so
signally broken the ties of personal gratitude in his desertion of the king
on that occasion, that, according to the severe remark of Hume, his
conduct required for ever afterwards the most upright, the most disinterested,
and most public-spirited behaviour to render it justifiable.
What then must we think of it, if we find in the whole of this great man's
political life nothing but ambition and rapacity in his motives, nothing
but treachery and intrigue in his means! He betrayed and abandoned
James, because he could not rise in his favour without a sacrifice that he
did not care to make; he abandoned William and betrayed England,
because some obstacles stood yet in the way of his ambition. I do not
mean only, when I say that he betrayed England, that he was ready to lay
her independence and liberty at the feet of James II. and Louis XIV.;
but that in one memorable instance he communicated to the court of
St. Germain's, and through that to the court of Versailles, the secret of an
expedition against Brest, which failed in consequence with the loss of the
commander and eight hundred men. Dalrymple, iii. 13; <i>Life of James</i>,
522; Macpherson, i. 487. In short, his whole life was such a picture of
meanness and treachery that one must rate military services very high
indeed to preserve any esteem for his memory.</p>

<p class="footnote">The private memoirs of James II. as well as the papers published by
Macpherson show us how little treason, and especially a double treason,
is thanked or trusted by those whom it pretends to serve. We see that
neither Churchill nor Russell obtained any confidence from the banished
king. Their motives were always suspected; and something more solid
than professions of loyalty was demanded, though at the expense of their
own credit. James could not forgive Russell for saying that, if the French
fleet came out, he must fight. Macpherson, i. 242. If Providence in its
wrath had visited this island once more with a Stuart restoration, we may
be sure that these perfidious apostates would have been no gainers by the
change.</p>

 During William's absence in Ireland in 1690, some of the whigs conducted
themselves in a manner to raise suspicions of their fidelity; as
appears by those most interesting letters of Mary published by Dalrymple,
which display her entire and devoted affection to a husband of cold and
sometimes harsh manners, but capable of deep and powerful attachment,
of which she was the chief object. I have heard that the late proprietor
of these royal letters was offended, but not judiciously, with their publication;
and that the black box of King William that contained them has
disappeared from Kensington. The names of the Duke of Bolton, his
son the Marquis of Winchester, the Earl of Monmouth, Lord Montagu, and
Major Wildman, occur as objects of the queen's or her minister's suspicion.
Dalrymple, Appendix, 107, etc. But Carmarthen was desirous to throw
odium on the whigs; and none of these, except on one occasion Lord
Winchester, appear to be mentioned in the Stuart Papers. Even Monmouth,
whose want both of principle and sound sense might cause reasonable
distrust, and who lay at different times of his life under this suspicion
of a Jacobite intrigue, is never mentioned in Macpherson, or any other
book of authority, within my recollection. Yet it is evident generally
that there was a disaffected party among the whigs, or, as in the Stuart
Papers they were called, republicans, who entertained the baseless project
of restoring James upon terms. These were chiefly what were called
compounders, to distinguish them from the thorough-paced royalists, or
old tories. One person whom we should least suspect is occasionally
spoken of as inclined to a king whom he had been ever conspicuous in
opposing&mdash;the Earl of Devonshire; but the Stuart agents often wrote
according to their wishes rather than their knowledge; and it seems hard
to believe what is not rendered probable by any part of his public conduct.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_183" id="Footnote_183" href="#FNanchor_183"><span class="label">[183]</span></a>
 This fact apparently rests on good authority; it is repeatedly mentioned
in the Stuart Papers, and in the <i>Life of James</i>. Yet Shrewsbury's letter
to William, after Fenwick's accusation of him, seems hardly consistent
with the king's knowledge of the truth of that charge in its full extent. I
think that he served his master faithfully as secretary, at least after some
time, though his warm recommendation of Marlborough "who has been
with me since this news [the failure of the attack on Brest] to offer his
services with all the expressions of duty and fidelity imaginable" (<i>Shrewsbury
Correspondence</i>, 47), is somewhat suspicious, aware as he was of that
traitor's connections.</p>

 Burnet says, "the elections of parliament (1690) went generally for
men who would probably have declared for King James, if they could have
known how to manage matters for him."&mdash;P. 41. This is quite an
exaggeration; though the tories, some of whom were at this time in place,
did certainly succeed in several divisions. But parties had now begun
to be split; the Jacobite tories voting with the malcontent whigs. Upon
the whole, this House of Commons, like the next which followed it, was
well affected to the revolution settlement and to public liberty. Whig
and tory were becoming little more than nicknames.</p>

or four. The great end James and his adherents had in view, was to
persuade Louis into an invasion of England; their representations therefore
are to be taken with much allowance, and in some cases we know them
to be false; as when James assures his brother of Versailles that three parts
at least in four of the English clergy had not taken the oaths to William.

 Many of these Jacobite tracts are printed in the Somers Collection,
vol. x. The more we read of them, the more cause appears for thankfulness
that the nation escaped from such a furious party. They confess, in
general, very little error or misgovernment in James, but abound with
malignant calumnies on his successor. The name of Tullia is repeatedly
given to the mild and pious Mary. The best of these libels is styled
"Great Britain's just complaint" (p. 429), by Sir James Montgomery, the
false and fickle proto-apostate of whiggism. It is written with singular
vigour, and even elegance; and rather extenuates than denies the faults
of the late reign.</p>

 Ralph, 418. See the <i>Life of James</i>, 501. It contains chiefly an
absolute promise of pardon, a declaration that he would protect and
defend the church of England as established by law, and secure to its
members all the churches, universities, schools, and colleges, together with
its immunities, rights, and privileges, a promise not to dispense with the
test, and to leave the dispensing power in other matters to be explained
and limited by parliament, to give the royal assent to bills for frequent
parliaments, free elections, and impartial trials, and to confirm such laws
made under the present usurpation as should be tendered to him by
parliament. "The king," he says himself, "was sensible he should be
blamed by several of his friends for submitting to such hard terms; nor
was it to be wondered at, if those who knew not the true condition of his
affairs were scandalised at it; but after all he had nothing else to do."&mdash;P.
505. He was so little satisfied with the articles in this declaration
respecting the church of England, that he consulted several French and
English divines, all of whom, including Bossuet, after some difference,
came to an opinion that he could not in conscience undertake to protect
and defend an erroneous church. Their objection, however, seems to
have been rather to the expression than the plain sense; for they agreed
that he might promise to leave the protestant church in possession of its
endowments and privileges. Many too of the English Jacobites, especially
the non-juring bishops, were displeased with the declaration, as limiting
the prerogative; though it contained nothing which they were not
clamorous to obtain from William. P. 514. A decisive proof how little
that party cared for civil liberty, and how little would have satisfied them
at the revolution, if James had put the church out of danger! The next
paragraph is remarkable enough to be extracted for the better confirmation
of what I have just said. "By this the king saw he had out-shot himself
more ways than one in this declaration; and therefore what expedient he
would have found in case he had been restored, not to put a force either
upon his conscience or honour, does not appear, because it never came to
a trial; but this is certain, his church of England friends absolved him
beforehand, and sent him word, that if he considered the preamble, and
the very terms of the declaration, he was not bound to stand by it, or to
put it out verbatim as it was worded; that the changing some expressions
and ambiguous terms, so long as what was principally aimed at had been
kept to, could not be called a receding from his declaration, no more than
a new edition of a book can be counted a different work, though corrected
and amended. And indeed the preamble showed his promise was conditional,
which they not performing, the king could not be tied; for my
Lord Middleton had writ, that, if the king signed the declaration, those who
took it engaged to restore him in three or four months after; the king did
his part, but their failure must needs take off the king's future obligation."</p>

<p class="footnote">In a Latin letter, the original of which is written in James's own hand,
to Innocent XII., dated from Dublin, Nov. 26, 1689, he declares himself
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catholicam fidem reducere in tria regna statuisse.</span>" <i>Somers Tracts</i>, x.
552. Though this may have been drawn up by a priest, I suppose the
king understood what he said. It appears also by Lord Balcarras's
<i>Memoir</i>, that Lord Melfort had drawn up the declaration as to indemnity
and indulgence in such a manner, that the king might break it whenever he
pleased. <i>Somers Tracts</i>, xi. 517.</p>

 The protestants were treated with neglect and jealousy, whatever
might have been their loyalty, at the court of James, as they were afterwards
as that of his son. The incorrigibility of this Stuart family is very
remarkable. Kennet, pp. 638 and 738, enumerates many instances. Sir
James Montgomery, the Earl of Middleton, and others, were shunned at
the court of St. Germain as guilty of this sole crime of heresy, unless we
add that of wishing for legal securities.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_193" id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a>
 James himself explicitly denies, in the extracts from his <i>Life</i>, published
by Macpherson, all participation in the scheme of killing William, and says
that he had twice rejected proposals for bringing him off alive; though it
is not true that he speaks of the design with indignation, as some have
pretended. It was very natural, and very conformable to the principles
of kings, and others besides kings, in former times, that he should have
lent an ear to this project; and as to James's moral and religious character
it was not better than that of Clarendon, whom we know to have countenanced
similar designs for the assassination of Cromwell. In fact, the
received code of ethics has been improved in this respect. We may be
sure at least, that those who ran such a risk for James's sake expected to
be thanked and rewarded in the event of success. I cannot therefore agree
with Dalrymple, who says that nothing but the fury of party could have
exposed James to this suspicion. Though the proof seems very short of
conviction, there are some facts worthy of notice. 1. Burnet positively
charges the late king with privity to the conspiracy of Grandval, executed
in Flanders for a design on William's life, 1692 (p. 95); and this he does
with so much particularity, and so little hesitation, that he seems to have
drawn his information from high authority. The sentence of the court-martial
on Grandval also alludes to James's knowledge of the crime
(<i>Somers Tracts</i>, x. 580), and mentions expressions of his, which, though
not conclusive, would raise a strong presumption in any ordinary case.
2. William himself, in a memorial intended to have been delivered to the
ministers of all the allied powers at Ryswick, in answer to that of James
(<i>Id.</i> xi. 103; Ralph, 730), positively imputes to the latter repeated conspiracies
against his life; and he was incapable of saying what he did not
believe. In the same memorial he shows too much magnanimity to assert
that the birth of the Prince of Wales was an imposture. 3. A paper by
Charnock, undeniably one of the conspirators, addressed to James, contains
a marked allusion to William's possible death in a short time; which even
Macpherson calls a delicate mode of hinting the assassination-plot to him.
Macpherson, <i>State Papers</i>, i. 519. Compare also <i>State Trials</i>, xii. 1323,
1327, 1329. 4. Somerville, though a disbeliever in James's participation,
has a very curious quotation from Lamberti, tending to implicate Louis
XIV. (p. 428); and we can hardly suppose that he kept the other out of
the secret. Indeed, the crime is greater and less credible in Louis than in
James. But devout kings have odd notions of morality; and their
confessors, I suppose, much the same. I admit, as before, that the
evidence falls short of conviction; and that the verdict, in the language of
Scots law, should be Not Proven; but it is too much for our Stuart
apologists to treat the question as one absolutely determined. Documents
may yet appear that will change its aspect.</p>

<p class="footnote">I leave the above paragraph as it was written before the publication of
M. Mazure's valuable <i>History of the Revolution</i>. He has therein brought
to light a commission of James to Crosby, in 1693, authorising and
requiring him "to seize and secure the person of the Prince of Orange, and
to bring him before us, taking to your assistance such other of our faithful
subjects in whom you may place confidence." <i>Hist. de la Révol.</i> iii. 443.
It is justly observed by M. Mazure, that Crosby might think no renewal of
his authority necessary in 1696 to do that which he had been required to
do in 1693. If we look attentively at James's own language, in Macpherson's
extracts, without much regarding the glosses of Innes, it will appear
that he does not deny in express terms that he had consented to the attempt
in 1696 to seize the Prince of Orange's person. In the commission to
Crosby he is required not only to do this, but <i>to bring him before the king</i>.
But is it possible to consider this language as anything else than an
euphemism for assassination?</p>

<p class="footnote">Upon the whole evidence, therefore, I now think that James was privy
to the conspiracy, of which the natural and inevitable consequence must
have been foreseen by himself; but I leave the text as it stood, in order
to show that I have not been guided by any prejudice against his character.</p>

but this majority lessened at every stage: and the final division was only

The editor has, in defiance of notorious facts, represented Sir

declining to answer questions put to him by members of the House of
Commons, which he could not have answered without inflaming the
animosity that sought his life.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is said in a note of Lord Hardwicke on Burnet, that "the king, before
the session, had Sir John Fenwick brought to the cabinet council, where
he was present himself. But Sir John would not explain his paper." See
also <i>Shrewsbury Correspondence</i>, 419 <i>et post</i>. The truth was, that Fenwick,
having had his information at second-hand, could not prove his assertions,
and feared to make his case worse by repeating them.</p>

 Godolphin, who was then first commissioner of the treasury, not much
to the liking of the whigs, seems to have been tricked by Sunderland into
retiring from office on this occasion. <i>Id.</i> 415. Shrewsbury, secretary of
state, could hardly be restrained by the king and his own friends from
resigning the seals as soon as he knew of Fenwick's accusation. His
behaviour shows either a consciousness of guilt, or an inconceivable
cowardice. Yet at first he wrote to the king, pretending to mention
candidly all that had passed between him and the Earl of Middleton, which
in fact amounted to nothing. P. 147. This letter, however, seems to
show that a story which has been several times told, and is confirmed by
the biographer of James II. and by Macpherson's <i>Papers</i>, that William
compelled Shrewsbury to accept office in 1693, by letting him know that
he was aware of his connection with St. Germains, is not founded in truth.
He could hardly have written in such a style to the king with that fact in
his way. Monmouth, however, had some suspicion of it; as appears by
the hints he furnished to Sir J. Fenwick towards establishing the charges.
P. 450. Lord Dartmouth, full of inveterate prejudices against the king,
charges him with personal pique against Sir John Fenwick, and with
instigating members to vote for the bill. Yet it rather seems that he was,
at least for some time, by no means anxious for it. <i>Shrewsbury Correspondence</i>;

 The debt at the king's death amounted to £16,394,702, of which above
three millions were to expire in 1710. Sinclair's <i>Hist. of Revenue</i>, i. 425
(third edition).</p>

<p class="footnote">Of this sum £664,263 was incurred before the revolution, being a part
of the money of which Charles II. had robbed the public creditor by
shutting up the exchequer. Interest was paid upon this down to 1683,
when the king stopped it. The legislature ought undoubtedly to have
done justice more effectually and speedily than by passing an act in 1699,
which was not to take effect till December 25, 1705; from which time the
excise was charged with three per cent. interest on the principal sum of
£1,328,526, subject to be redeemed by payment of a moiety. No compensation
was given for the loss of so many years' interest. 12 &amp; 13 W. 3,
c. 12, § 15; Sinclair, i. 397; <i>State Trials</i>, xiv. 1 <i>et post</i>. According to a
particular statement in <i>Somers Tracts</i>, xii. 383, the receipts of the exchequer,
including loans, during the whole reign of William, amounted to rather
more than £72,000,000. The author of the "Letter to the Rev. T. Carte,"
in answer to the latter's "Letter to a Bystander," estimates the sums
raised under Charles II., from Christmas 1660 to Christmas 1684, at
£46,233,923. Carte had made them only £32,474,265. But his estimate
is evidently false and deceptive. Both reckon the gross produce, not the
exchequer payments. This controversy was about the year 1742. According
to Sinclair, <i>Hist. of Revenue</i>, i. 309, Carte had the last word; but I
cannot conceive how he answered the above-mentioned letter to him.
Whatever might be the relative expenditure of the two reigns, it is evident
that the war of 1689 was brought on, in a great measure, by the corrupt
policy of Charles II.</p>

if he did not know, what havoc the Dutch had made of our shipping in
King Charles the Second's reign; and that his successor, King James the
Second, had not in his whole navy, fitted out to defeat the designed
invasion of the Prince of Orange, an individual ship of the first or second

through by him against the mutinous remonstrances of Russell. See
pp. 68, 104, 202, 210, 234. This was a most odious man; as ill-tempered
and violent as he was perfidious. But the rudeness with which the
king was treated by some of his servants is very remarkable. Lord
Sunderland wrote to him at least with great bluntness. <i>Hardwicke

 The peace of Ryswick was absolutely necessary, not only on account
of the defection of the Duke of Savoy, and the manifest disadvantage with
which the allies carried on the war, but because public credit in England
was almost annihilated, and it was hardly possible to pay the army. The
extreme distress for money is forcibly displayed in some of the king's
letters to Lord Shrewsbury. P. 114, etc. These were in 1696, the very <i>nadir</i>
of English prosperity; from which, by the favour of Providence and the
buoyant energies of the nation, we have, though not quite with an uniform
motion, culminated to our present height (1824).</p>

<p class="footnote">If the treaty could have been concluded on the basis originally laid down,
it would even have been honourable. But the French rose in their terms
during the negotiation; and through the selfishness of Austria obtained
Strasburgh, which they had at first offered to relinquish, and were very near
getting Luxemburg. <i>Shrewsbury Correspondence</i>, 316, etc. Still the terms
were better than those offered in 1693, which William has been censured
for refusing.</p>

 "The elections fell generally," says Burnet, "on men who were in the
interest of government; many of them had indeed some popular notions,
which they had drank in under a bad government, and thought this ought
to keep them under a good one; so that those who wished well to the
public did apprehend great difficulties in managing them." Upon which
Speaker Onslow has a very proper note: "They might happen to think,"
he says, "a good one might become a bad one, or a bad one might succeed
to a good one. They were the best men of the age, and were for maintaining
the revolution government by its own principles, and not by those
of a government it had superseded." "The elections," we read in a letter
of Mr. Montague, Aug. 1698, "have made a humour appear in the counties
that is not very comfortable to us who are in business. But yet after all,
the present members are such as will neither hurt England nor this government,
but I believe they must be handled very nicely." <i>Shrewsbury
Correspondence</i>, 551. This parliament, however, fell into a great mistake
about the reduction of the army; as Bolingbroke in his <i>Letters on History</i>
very candidly admits, though connected with those who had voted for it.</p>

beyond doubt that William had serious thoughts of quitting the government,
and retiring to Holland, sick of the faction and ingratitude of this
nation. <i>Shrewsbury Correspondence</i>, 571; <i>Hardwicke Papers</i>, 362. This
was in his character, and not like the vulgar story which that retailer of all
gossip, Dalrymple, calls a well-authenticated tradition, that the king
walked furiously round his room, exclaiming, "If I had a son, by G&mdash; the
guards should not leave me." It would be vain to ask how this son would
have enabled him to keep them against the bent of the parliament and
people.</p>

 The prodigality of William in grants to his favourites was an undeniable
reproach to his reign. Charles II. had, however, with much greater profuseness,
though much less blamed for it, given away almost all the Crown
lands in a few years after the restoration; and the Commons could not
now be prevailed upon to shake those grants, which was urged by the
court, in order to defeat the resumption of those in the present reign. The
length of time undoubtedly made a considerable difference. An enormous
grant of the Crown's domanial rights in North Wales to the Earl of
Portland excited much clamour in 1697, and produced a speech from
Mr. Price, afterwards a baron of the exchequer, which was much extolled
for its boldness, not rather to say, virulence and disaffection. This is
printed in <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 978, and many other books. The king, on an
address from the House of Commons, revoked the grant, which indeed
was not justifiable. His answer on this occasion, it may here be remarked,
was by its mildness and courtesy a striking contrast to the insolent rudeness
with which the Stuarts, one and all, had invariably treated the house.
Yet to this vomit were many wretches eager to return.</p>

 <i>Parl. Hist.</i>; <i>State Trials</i>, xiv. 233. The letters of William, published
in the <i>Hardwicke State Papers</i>, are both the most authentic and the most
satisfactory explanation of his policy during the three momentous years
that closed the seventeenth century. It is said, in a note of Lord Hardwicke
on Burnet (Oxford edit. iv. 417), (from Lord Somers's papers), that
when some of the ministers objected to parts of the treaty, Lord Portland's
constant answer was, that nothing could be altered; upon which one of
them said, if that was the case, he saw no reason why they should be called
together. And it appears by the <i>Shrewsbury Papers</i>, p. 371, that the duke,
though secretary of state, and in a manner prime minister, was entirely
kept by the king out of the secret of the negotiations which ended in the
peace of Ryswick: whether, after all, there remained some lurking distrust
of his fidelity, or from whatever other cause this took place, it was very
anomalous and unconstitutional. And it must be owned, that by this
sort of proceeding, which could have no sufficient apology but a deep
sense of the unworthiness of mankind, William brought on himself much
of that dislike which appears so ungrateful and unaccountable.</p>

<p class="footnote">As to the impeachments, few have pretended to justify them; even
Ralph is half ashamed of the party he espouses with so little candour
towards their adversaries. The scandalous conduct of the tories in
screening the Earl of Jersey, while they impeached the whig lords, some
of whom had really borne no part in a measure he had promoted, sufficiently
displays the factiousness of their motives. See Lord Haversham's
speech on this. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 1298.</p>

 3 Inst. 12; 1 Hale's <i>Pleas of the Crown</i>, 120; Foster, 195. Coke lays
it down positively (p. 14) that a conspiracy to levy war is not high treason,
as an overt act of compassing the king's death. "For this were to confound
the several classes or <i>membra dividentia</i>." Hale objects that Coke
himself cites the case of Lords Essex and Southampton, which seems to
contradict that opinion. But it may be answered, in the first place, that a
conspiracy to levy war was made high treason during the life of Elizabeth;
and secondly, that Coke's words as to that case are, that they "intended
to go to the court where the queen was, and to have taken her into their
power, and to have removed divers of her council, and <i>for that end did
assemble a multitude of people</i>: this being raised to the end aforesaid, was
a sufficient overt act of compassing the death of the queen." The earliest
case is that of Storie, who was convicted of compassing the queen's death on
evidence of exciting a foreign power to invade the kingdom. But he was
very obnoxious; and the precedent is not good. Hale, 122.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is also held that an actual levying war may be laid as an overt act of
compassing the king's death, which indeed follows <i>à fortiori</i> from the former
proposition; provided it be not a constructive rebellion, but one really
directed against the royal authority. Hale, 123.</p>

having arisen on Lord Russell's trial, gave rise to a controversy between

 In the whole series of authorities, however, on this subject, it will be
found that the probable danger to the king's safety from rebellion was the
ground-work upon which this constructive treason rested; nor did either
Hale or Foster, Pemberton or Holt, ever dream that any other death was
intended by the statute than that of nature. It was reserved for a modern
Crown lawyer to resolve this language into a metaphysical personification,
and to argue that the king's person being interwoven with the state, and
its sole representative, any conspiracy against the constitution must of its
own nature be a conspiracy against his life. <i>State Trials</i>, xxiv. 1183.</p>

 Foster, 198. He seems to concur in Hale's opinion, that words which
being spoken will not amount to an overt act to make good an indictment
for compassing the king's death, yet if reduced into writing, and published,
will make such an overt act, "if the matters contained in them import
such a compassing." Hale's <i>Pleas of Crown</i>, 118. But this is indefinitely
expressed, the words marked as a quotation looking like a truism, and
contrary to the first part of the sentence; and the case of Williams, under
James I., which Hales cites in corroboration of this, will hardly be approved
by any constitutional lawyer.</p>

 This is the well known case of Damaree and Purchase. <i>State Trials</i>,
xv. 520; Foster, 213. A rabble had attended Sacheverell from Westminster
to his lodgings in the Temple. Some among them proposed to
pull down the meeting-houses; a cry was raised, and several of these were
destroyed. It appeared to be their intention to pull down all within their
reach. Upon this overt act of levying war the prisoners were convicted;
some of the judges differing as to one of them, but merely on the application
of the evidence to his case. Notwithstanding this solemn decision, and
the approbation with which Sir Michael Foster has stamped it, some
difficulty would arise in distinguishing this case, as reported, from many
indictments under the riot act for mere felony; and especially from those
of the Birmingham rioters in 1791, where the similarity of motives, though
the mischief in the latter instance was far more extensive, would naturally
have suggested the same species of prosecution as was adopted against
Damaree and Purchase. It may be remarked that neither of these men
was executed; which, notwithstanding the sarcastic observation of Foster,
might possibly be owing to an opinion, which every one but a lawyer must
have entertained, that their offence did not amount to treason.</p>

parties care should be taken about them, or all parties will suffer in their
turns. Plunket, and Sidney, and Ashton were doubtless all murdered
though they were never so guilty of the crimes wherewith they were
charged; the one tried twice, the other found guilty upon one evidence,
and the last upon nothing but presumptive proof." Even the prostitute
lawyer, Sir Bartholomew Shower, had the assurance to complain of uncertainty
in the law of treason. <i>Id.</i> 572. And Roger North, in his <i>Examen</i>,

 When several persons of distinction were arrested on account of a
jacobite conspiracy in 1690, there was but one witness against some of
them. The judges were consulted whether they could be indicted for a
high misdemeanour on this single testimony, as Hampden had been in
1685; the attorney-general Treby maintaining this to be lawful. Four of
the judges were positively against this, two more doubtfully the same
way, one altogether doubtful, and three in favour of it. The scheme was
very properly abandoned; and at present, I suppose, nothing can be more
established than the negative. Dalrymple, Append. 186.</p>

 The dexterity with which Lord Shaftesbury (the author of the
<i>Characteristics</i>), at that time in the House of Commons, turned a momentary
confusion which came upon him while speaking on this bill, into an argument
for extending the aid of counsel to those who might so much more
naturally be embarrassed on a trial for their lives, is well known. All
well-informed writers ascribe this to Shaftesbury. But Johnson, in the
<i>Lives of the Poets</i>, has, through inadvertence, as I believe, given Lord
Halifax (Montagu) the credit of it; and some have since followed him.
As a complete refutation of this mistake, it is sufficient to say that Mr.
Montagu <i>opposed</i> the bill. His name appears as a teller on two divisions,

 See the pamphlets of that age, <i>passim</i>. One of these, entitled "The

and toleration are things only to be talked of and pretended to by
those that are under; but none like or think it reasonable that are in
authority. 'Tis an instrument of mischief and dissettlement, to be
courted by those who would have change, but no way desirable by such
as would be quiet, and have the government undisturbed. For it is not
consistent with public peace and safety without a standing army; conventicles
being eternal nurseries of sedition and rebellion."&mdash;P. 30. "To
strive for toleration," he says in another place, "is to contend against all
government. It will come to this; whether there should be a government
in the church or not? for if there be a government, there must be laws;
if there be laws, there must be penalties annexed to the violation of those
laws; otherwise the government is precarious and at every man's mercy;
that is, it is none at all.... The constitution should be made firm,
whether with any alterations or without them, and laws put in punctual
vigorous execution. Till that is done all will signify nothing. The church
hath lost all through remissness and non-execution of laws; and by the
contrary course things must be reduced, or they never will. To what
purpose are parliaments so concerned to prepare good laws, if the officers
who are intrusted with the execution neglect that duty, and let them lie
dead? This brings laws and government into contempt, and it were much
better the laws were never made; by these the dissenters are provoked,
and being not restrained by the exacting of the penalties, they are fiercer
and more bent upon their own ways than they would be otherwise. But
it may be said the execution of laws of conformity raiseth the cry of persecution;
and will not that be scandalous? Not so scandalous as anarchy,
schism, and eternal divisions and confusions both in church and state.
Better that the unruly should clamour than that the regular should groan,
and all should be undone."&mdash;P. 33. Another tract, "Short Defence of the
Church and Clergy of England, 1679," declares for union (in his own way),
but against a comprehension, and still more a toleration. "It is observable
that whereas the best emperors have made the severest laws against
all manner of sectaries, Julian the apostate, the most subtle and bitter
enemy that Christianity ever had, was the man that set up this way of
toleration."&mdash;P. 87. Such was the temper of this odious faction. And
at the time they were instigating the government to fresh severities, by
which, I sincerely believe, they meant the pillory or the gallows (for
nothing else was wanting), scarce a gaol in England was without nonconformist
ministers. One can hardly avoid rejoicing that some of these
men, after the revolution, experienced, not indeed the persecution, but the
poverty they had been so eager to inflict on others.</p>

<p class="footnote">The following passage from a very judicious tract on the other side,
"Discourse of the Religion of England, 1667," may deserve to be extracted.
"Whether cogent reason speaks for this latitude, be it now considered.
How momentous in the balance of this nation those protestants are which
are dissatisfied in the present ecclesiastical polity. They are everywhere
spread through city and country; they make no small part of all ranks
and sorts of men; by relations and commerce they are so woven into the
nation's interest, that it is not easy to sever them without unravelling the
whole. They are not excluded from the nobility, among the gentry they
are not a few; but none are of more importance than they in the trading
part of the people and those that live by industry, upon whose hands the
business of the nation lies much. It hath been noted that some who bear
them no good will have said that the very air of corporations is infested
with their contagion. And in whatsoever degree they are high or low,
ordinarily for good understanding, steadiness and sobriety, they are not
inferior to others of the same rank and quality; neither do they want the
rational courage of Englishmen."&mdash;P. 23.</p>

 Leslie's <i>Case of the Regale and Pontificate</i> is a long dull attempt to set
up the sacerdotal order above all civil power, at least as to the exercise of
its functions, and especially to get rid of the appointment of bishops by
the Crown, or, by parity of reasoning, of priests by laymen. He is indignant
even at laymen choosing their chaplains, and thinks they ought to
take them from the bishop; objecting also to the phrase, my chaplain, as
if they were servants: "otherwise the expression is proper enough to say
my chaplain, as I say my parish priest, my bishop, my king, or my God;
which argues my being under their care and direction, and that I belong
to them, not they to me."&mdash;P. 182. It is full of enormous misrepresentation

 No opposition seems to have been made in the House of Commons;
but we have a protest from four peers against it. Burnet, though he offers
some shameful arguments in favour of the bill, such as might justify any
tyranny, admits that it contained some unreasonable severities, and that
many were really adverse to it. A bill proposed in 1705, to render the late
act against papists effective, was lost by 119 to 43 (<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vi. 514);
which shows that men were ashamed of what they had done. A proclamation,
however, was issued in 1711, immediately after Guiscard's attempt
to kill Mr. Harley, for enforcing the penal laws against Roman catholics,
which was very scandalous, as tending to impute that crime to them.

 While the bill regulating the succession was in the House of Commons,
a proviso was offered by Mr. Godolphin, that nothing in this act is intended
to be drawn into example or consequence hereafter, to prejudice the right
of any protestant prince or princess in their hereditary succession to the
imperial crown of those realms. This was much opposed by the whigs;
both because it tended to let in the son of James II., if he should become
a protestant, and for a more secret reason, that they did not like to
recognise the continuance of any hereditary right. It was rejected by
179 to 125. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> v. 249. The Lords' amendment in favour of the

 It was frequently contended in the reign of George II. that subsidiary
treaties for the defence of Hanover, or rather such as were covertly
designed for that and no other purpose, as those with Russia and Hesse
Cassel in 1755, were at least contrary to the spirit of the act of settlement.
On the other hand it was justly answered that, although in case Hanover
should be attacked on the ground of a German quarrel, unconnected with
English politics, we were not bound to defend her; yet, if a power at war
with England should think fit to consider that electorate as part of the
king's dominions (which perhaps according to the law of nations might be
done), our honour must require that it should be defended against such an
attack. This is true; and yet it shows very forcibly that the separation
of the two ought to have been insisted upon; since the present connection
engages Great Britain in a very disadvantageous mode of carrying on its
wars, without any compensation of national wealth or honour; except
indeed that of employing occasionally in its service a very brave and
efficient body of troops.</p>

recent act of settlement. "As to the setting of the great seal of England
to foreign alliances, the lord chancellor, or lord keeper for the time being,
has a plain rule to follow; that is, humbly to inform the king that he
cannot legally set the great seal of England to a matter of that consequence

 This very delicate question as to the responsibility of the cabinet, or
what is commonly called the ministry <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in solidum</span></i>, if I may use the expression,
was canvassed in a remarkable discussion within our memory, on the
introduction of the late chief justice of the King's Bench into that select
body; Mr. Fox strenuously denying the proposition, and Lord Castlereagh,
with others now living, maintaining it. <i>Parl. Debates</i>, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1806. I
cannot possibly comprehend how an article of impeachment, for sitting as
a cabinet minister could be drawn; nor do I conceive that a privy counsellor
has a right to resign his place at the board; so that it would be highly
unjust and illegal to presume a participation in culpable measures from
the mere circumstance of belonging to it. Even if notoriety be a ground,
as has been sometimes contended, for impeachment, it cannot be sufficient
for conviction.</p>

 This is the modern usage, but of its origin I cannot speak. On one

of course intended to show the determination of parliament not to be

 <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 807, 840. Burnet says (p. 42) that Sir John Trevor, a tory,
first put the king on this method of corruption. Trevor himself was so
venal that he received a present of 1000 guineas from the city of London,
being then speaker of the Commons, for his service in carrying a bill through
the house; and, upon its discovery, was obliged to put the vote, that he
had been guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour. This resolution being
carried, he absented himself from the house, and was expelled. <i>Parl.
Hist.</i> 900; Commons' Journals, 12th March 1694-5. The Duke of Leeds,
that veteran of secret iniquity, was discovered about the same time to
have taken bribes from the East India Company, and was impeached in
consequence; I say discovered, for there seems little or no doubt of his
guilt. The impeachment, however, was not prosecuted for want of
evidence. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 881, 911, 933. Guy, secretary of the treasury,

of government came to light through the inquisitive spirit of parliament
in this reign; not that the nation was worse and more corrupt than under
the Stuarts, but that a profligacy, which had been engendered and had
flourished under their administration, was now dragged to light and
punishment. Long sessions of parliament and a vigilant party-spirit
exposed the evil, and have finally in a great measure removed it; though
Burnet's remark is still not wholly obsolete. "The regard," says that
honest bishop, "that is shown to the members of parliament among us,
makes that few abuses can be inquired into or discovered."</p>

 <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 748, 829. The house resolved, "that whoever advised the
king not to give the royal assent to the act touching free and impartial
proceedings in parliament, which was to redress a grievance, and take off
a scandal upon the proceedings of the Commons in parliament, is an
enemy to their majesties and the kingdom." They laid a representation
before the king, showing how few instances have been in former reigns of
denying the royal assent to bills for redress of grievances, and the great
grief of the Commons "for his not having given the royal assent to several
public bills, and particularly the bill touching free and impartial proceedings
in parliament, which tended so much to the clearing the reputation
of this house, after their having so freely voted to supply the public
occasions." The king gave a courteous but evasive answer, as indeed it
was natural to expect; but so great a flame was raised in the Commons,
that it was moved to address him for a further answer, which, however,
there was still a sense of decorum sufficient to prevent.</p>

<p class="footnote">Though the particular provisions of this bill do not appear, I think it

 The House of Commons introduced into the act of security, as it was
called, a long clause, carried on a division by 167 to 160, Jan. 24, 1706,
enumerating various persons who should be eligible to parliament; the
principal officers of state, the commissioners of treasury and admiralty,
and a limited number of other placemen. The Lords thought fit to repeal
the whole prohibitory enactment. It was resolved in the Commons, by
a majority of 205 to 183, that they would not agree to this amendment.
A conference accordingly took place, when the managers of the Commons
objected (Feb. 7) that a total repeal of that provision would admit such
an unlimited number of officers to sit in their house, as might destroy the
free and impartial proceedings in parliament, and endanger the liberties
of the Commons of England. Those on the Lords' side gave their reasons
to the contrary at great length, Feb. 11. The Commons determined
(Feb. 18) to insert the provision vacating the seat of a member accepting
office; and resolved not to insist on their disagreements as to the main
clause. Three protests were entered in the House of Lords against
inserting the word "repealed" in reference to the prohibitory clause,
instead of "regulated and altered," all by tory peers. It is observable
that, as the provision was not to take effect till the house of Hanover should
succeed to the throne, the sticklers for it might be full as much influenced
by their ill-will to that family as by their zeal for liberty.</p>

consequently did not always support Godolphin. P. 210, etc. Mr.

 "The managers appointed by the House of Commons," says an ardent
jacobite, "behaved with all the insolence imaginable. In their discourse
they boldly asserted, even in her majesty's presence, that, if the right to
the crown was hereditary and indefeasible, the prince beyond the seas,
meaning the king, and not the queen, had the legal title to it, she having
no claim thereto, but what she owed to the people; and that by the revolution
principles, on which the constitution was founded and to which the
laws of the land agreed, the people might turn out or lay aside their
sovereigns as they saw cause. Though, no doubt of it, there was a great
deal of truth in these assertions, it is easy to be believed that the queen
was not well pleased to hear them maintained, even in her own presence
and in so solemn a manner, before such a great concourse of her subjects.
For, though princes do cherish these and the like doctrines, whilst they
serve as the means to advance themselves to a crown, yet being once
possessed thereof, they have as little satisfaction in them as those who
succeed by an hereditary unquestionable title." <i>Lockhart Papers</i>, i. 312.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is probable enough that the last remark has its weight, and that
the queen did not wholly like the speeches of some of the managers; and
yet nothing can be more certain than that she owed her crown in the first
instance, and the preservation of it at that very time, to those insolent
doctrines which wounded her royal ear; and that the genuine loyalists
would soon have lodged her in the Tower.</p>

Sacheverell's counsel, except Phipps, were ashamed of him; which is
really not far from the case. "The doctor," says Lockhart, "employed
Sir Simon, afterwards Lord Harcourt, and Sir Constantine Phipps as his
counsel, who defended him the best way they could, though they were hard
put to it to maintain the hereditary right and unlimited doctrine of non-resistance,
and not condemn the revolution. And the truth on it is, these
are so inconsistent with one another that the chief arguments alleged in
this and other parallel cases came to no more than this; that the revolution
was an exception from the nature of government in general, and the
constitution and laws of Britain in particular, which necessity in that
particular case made expedient and lawful." <i>Ibid.</i></p>

 Cunningham says that the Duke of Leeds spoke strongly in favour
of the revolution, though he voted Sacheverell not guilty. P. 298.

for rendering the revolution lawful.</p>

 The homilies are so much more vehement against resistance than
Sacheverell was, that it would have been awkward to pass a rigorous
sentence on him. In fact, he or any other clergyman had a right to
preach the homily against rebellion instead of a sermon. As to their
laying down general rules without adverting to the exceptions, an apology
which the managers set up for them, it was just as good for Sacheverell;
and the homilies expressly deny all possible exceptions. Tillotson had a
plan of dropping these old compositions, which in some doctrinal points,
as well as in the tenet of non-resistance, do not represent the sentiments
of the modern church, though, in a general way, it subscribes to them.
But the times were not ripe for this, or some other of that good prelate's
designs. Wordsworth's <i>Eccles. Biog.</i> vol. vi. The quotations from the
homilies and other approved works by Sacheverell's counsel are irresistible,
and must have increased the party spirit of the clergy. "No conjuncture
of circumstances whatever," says Bishop Sanderson, "can make that
expedient to be done at any time that is of itself, and in the kind, unlawful.
For a man to take up arms offensive or defensive against a lawful sovereign,
being a thing in its nature simply and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de toto genere</span></i> unlawful, may not be
done by any man, at any time, in any case, upon any colour or pretence

 The late biographer of Marlborough asserts that he was against
breaking off the conferences in 1709, though clearly for insisting on the
cession of Spain (iii. 40). Godolphin, Somers, and the whigs in general,
expected Louis XIV. to yield the thirty-seventh article. Cowper, however,
was always doubtful of this. <i>Id.</i> 176.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is very hard to pronounce, as it appears to me, on the great problem
of Louis's sincerity in this negotiation. No decisive evidence seems to
have been brought on the contrary side. The most remarkable authority
that way is a passage in the <i>Mémoires of St. Phelipe</i>, iii. 263, who certainly
asserts that the King of France had, without the knowledge of any of his
ministers, assured his grandson of a continued support. But the question
returns as to St. Phelipe's means of knowing so important a secret. On
the other hand, I cannot discover in the long correspondence between
Madame de Maintenon and the Princesse des Ursins the least corroboration
of these suspicions, but much to the contrary effect. Nor does Torcy drop
a word, though writing when all was over, by which we should infer that
the court of Versailles had any other hopes left in 1709, than what still
lingered in their heart from the determined spirit of the Castilians themselves.</p>

<p class="footnote">It appears by the <i>Mémoires de Noailles</i>, iii. 10 (edit. 1777), that Louis
wrote to Philip, 26th Nov. 1708, hinting that he must reluctantly give him
up, in answer to one wherein the latter had declared that he would not
quit Spain while he had a drop of blood in his veins. And on the French
ambassador at Madrid, Amelot, remonstrating against the abandonment
of Spain, with an evident intimation that Philip could not support himself
alone, the King of France answered that he must end the war at any price.
15th April 1709. <i>Id.</i> 34. In the next year, after the battle of Saragosa,
which seemed to turn the scale wholly against Philip, Noailles was sent to
Madrid in order to persuade that prince to abandon the contest. <i>Id.</i> 107.
There were some in France who would even have accepted the thirty-seventh
article, of whom Madame de Maintenon seems to have been.
P. 117. We may perhaps think that an explicit offer of Naples, on the
part of the allies, would have changed the scene; nay, it seems as if Louis
would have been content at this time with Sardinia and Sicily. P. 108.</p>

 A contemporary historian of remarkable gravity observes: "It was
strange to see how much the desire of French wine, and the dearness of it,
alienated many men from the Duke of Marlborough's friendship." Cunningham,
ii. 220. The hard drinkers complained that they were poisoned
by port; these formed almost a party: Dr. Aldrich (Dean of Christchurch,
surnamed the priest of Bacchus), Dr. Ratcliffe, General Churchill, etc.
"And all the bottle companions, many physicians, and great numbers of
the lawyers and inferior clergy, and, in fine, the loose women too, were
united together in the faction against the Duke of Marlborough."</p>

 A bill was attempted in 1704 to recruit the army by a forced conscription
of men from each parish, but laid aside as unconstitutional.
Boyer's <i>Reign of Queen Anne</i>, p. 123. It was tried again in 1707 with like
success. P. 319. But it was resolved instead to bring in a bill for raising
a sufficient number of troops out of such persons as have no lawful calling
or employment. Stat. 4 Anne, c. 10; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> 335. The parish
officers were thus enabled to press men for the land service; a method
hardly more unconstitutional than the former, and liable to enormous
abuses. The act was temporary, but renewed several times during the
war. It was afterwards revived in 1757 (30 Geo. 2, c. 8), but never, I
believe, on any later occasion.</p>

 Every contemporary writer bears testimony to the exhaustion of France,
rendered still more deplorable by the unfavourable season of 1709, which
produced a famine. Madame de Maintenon's letters to the Princess des
Ursins are full of the public misery, which she did not soften, out of some
vain hope that her inflexible correspondent might relent at length, and
prevail on the King and Queen of Spain to abandon their throne.</p>

 It is evident from Macpherson's <i>Papers</i>, that all hopes of a restoration
in the reign of Anne were given up in England. They soon revived,
however, as to Scotland, and grew stronger about the time of the union.</p>

 The <i>Rehearsal</i> is not written in such a manner as to gain over many
proselytes. The scheme of fighting against liberty with her own arms had
not yet come into vogue; or rather Leslie was too mere a bigot to practise
it. He is wholly for arbitrary power; but the commons stuff of his
journal is high-church notions of all descriptions. This could not win
many in the reign of Anne.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_320" id="Footnote_320" href="#FNanchor_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a>
 Macpherson, i. 608. If Carte's anecdotes are true, which is very doubtful,
Godolphin, after he was turned out, declared his concern at not having
restored the king; that he thought Harley would do it, but by French
assistance, which he did not intend; that the tories had always distressed
him, and his administration had passed in a struggle with the whig junto.
<i>Id.</i> 170. Somerville says, he was assured that Carte was reckoned credulous
and ill-informed by the jacobites. P. 273. It seems indeed, by some
passages in Macpherson's <i>Papers</i>, that the Stuart agents either kept up
an intercourse with Godolphin, or pretended to do so. Vol. ii. 2 <i>et post</i>.
But it is evident that they had no confidence in him.</p>

<p class="footnote">It must be observed, however, that Lord Dartmouth, in his notes on
Burnet, repeatedly intimates that Godolphin's secret object in his ministry
was the restoration of the house of Stuart, and that with this view he
suffered the act of security in Scotland to pass, which raised such a clamour
that he was forced to close with the whigs in order to save himself. It is
said also by a very good authority, Lord Hardwicke (note on Burnet, Oxf.
edit. v. 352) that there was something not easy to be accounted for in the
conduct of the ministry, preceding the attempt on Scotland in 1708;
giving us to understand in the subsequent part of the note that Godolphin
was suspected of connivance with it. And this is confirmed by Ker of
Kersland, who directly charges the treasurer with extreme remissness, if
not something worse. <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 54. See also Lockhart's <i>Commentaries</i>
(in <i>Lockhart Papers</i>, i. 308). Yet it seems almost impossible to suspect
Godolphin of such treachery, not only towards the protestant succession,
but his mistress herself.</p>

 The pamphlets on Harley's side, and probably written under his
inspection, for at least the first year after his elevation to power, such as
one entitled "Faults on both Sides," ascribed to Richard Harley, his
relation (<i>Somers Tracts</i>, xii. 678); "Spectator's Address to the Whigs on
Occasion of the stabbing Mr. Harley," or the "Secret History of the
October Club," 1711 (I believe by De Foe), seem to have for their object
to reconcile as many of the whigs as possible to his administration, and to
display his aversion to the violent tories. There can be no doubt that his
first project was to have excluded the more acrimonious whigs, such as
Wharton and Sunderland, as well as the Duke of Marlborough and his
wife, and coalesced with Cowper and Somers, both of whom were also in
favour with the queen. But the steadiness of the whig party, and their
resentment of his duplicity, forced him into the opposite quarters, though
he never lost sight of his schemes for reconciliation.</p>

<p class="footnote">The dissembling nature of this unfortunate statesman rendered his
designs suspected. The whigs, at least in 1713, in their correspondence
with the court of Hanover, speak of him as entirely in the jacobite interest.
Macpherson, ii. 472, 509. Cunningham, who is not on the whole unfavourable
to Harley, says, that "men of all parties agreed in concluding
that his designs were in the Pretender's favour. And it is certain that he
affected to have it thought so."&mdash;P. 303. Lockhart also bears witness to
the reliance placed on him by the jacobites, and argues with some plausibility
(p. 377) that the Duke of Hamilton's appointment as ambassador to
France, in 1712, must have been designed to further their object; though
he believed that the death of that nobleman, in a duel with Lord Mohun,
just as he was setting out for Paris, put a stop to the scheme, and "questions
if it was ever heartily re-assumed by Lord Oxford."&mdash;"This I know,
that his lordship regretting to a friend of mine the duke's death, next day
after it happened, told him that it disordered all their schemes, seeing
Great Britain did not afford a person capable to discharge the trust which
was committed to his grace, which sure was somewhat very extraordinary;
and what other than the king's restoration could there be of so very great
importance, or require such dexterity in managing, is not easy to imagine.
And indeed it is more than probable that before his lordship could pitch
upon one he might depend on in such weighty matters, the discord and
division which happened betwixt him and the other ministers of state
diverted or suspended his design of serving the king." Lockhart's <i>Commentaries</i>,
p. 410. But there is more reason to doubt whether this design
to serve the king ever existed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_326" id="Footnote_326" href="#FNanchor_326"><span class="label">[326]</span></a>
 If we may trust to a book printed in 1717, with the title, "Minutes of
Monsieur Mesnager's Negotiations with the Court of England towards the
Close of the last Reign, written by himself," that agent of the French
cabinet entered into an arrangement with Bolingbroke in March 1712,
about the Pretender. It was agreed that Louis should ostensibly abandon
him, but should not be obliged, in case of the queen's death, not to use
endeavours for his restoration. Lady Masham was wholly for this; but
owned "the rage and irreconcilable aversion of the greatest part of the
common people to her (the queen's) brother was grown to a height." But
I must confess that, although Macpherson has extracted the above passage,
and a more judicious writer, Somerville, quotes the book freely as genuine
(<i>Hist. of Anne</i>, p. 581, etc.), I found in reading it what seemed to me the
strongest grounds of suspicion. It is printed in England, without a word
of preface to explain how such important secrets came to be divulged, or
by what means the book came before the world; the correct information
as to English customs and persons frequently betrays a native pen; the
truth it contains, as to jacobite intrigues, might have transpired from other
sources, and in the main was pretty well suspected, as the Report of the
Secret Committee on the Impeachments in 1715 shows; so that, upon the
whole, I cannot but reckon it a forgery in order to injure the tory leaders.</p>

<p class="footnote">But however this may be, we find Bolingbroke in correspondence with
the Stuart agents in the later part of 1712. Macpherson, 366. And his
own correspondence with Lord Strafford shows his dread and dislike of
Hanover (<i>Bol. Corr.</i> ii. 487 <i>et alibi</i>). The Duke of Buckingham wrote to
St. Germains in July that year, with strong expressions of his attachment
to the cause, and pressing the necessity of the prince's conversion to the
protestant religion. Macpherson, 327. Ormond is mentioned in the Duke
of Berwick's letters as in correspondence with him; and Lockhart says
there was no reason to make the least question of his affection to the king,
whose friends were consequently well pleased at his appointment to succeed
Marlborough in the command of the army, and thought it portended some
good designs in favour of him. <i>Id.</i> 376.</p>

<p class="footnote">Of Ormond's sincerity in this cause there can indeed be little doubt;
but there is almost as much reason to suspect that of Bolingbroke as of
Oxford; except that, having more rashness and less principle, he was
better fitted for so dangerous a counter-revolution. But in reality he had
a perfect contempt for the Stuart and tory notions of government, and
would doubtless have served the house of Hanover with more pleasure, if
his prospects in that quarter had been more favourable. It appears that
in the session of 1714, when he had become lord of the ascendant, he disappointed
the zealous royalists by his delays as much as his more cautious
rival had done before. Lockhart, 470. This writer repeatedly asserts
that a majority of the House of Commons, both in the parliament of 1710
and that of 1713, wanted only the least encouragement from the court to
have brought about the repeal of the act of settlement. But I think this
very doubtful; and I am quite convinced that the nation would not have
acquiesced in it. Lockhart is sanguine, and ignorant of England.</p>

<p class="footnote">It must be admitted that part of the cabinet were steady to the protestant
succession. Lord Dartmouth, Lord Powlett, Lord Trevor, and the Bishop
of London were certainly so; nor can there be any reasonable doubt, as I
conceive, of the Duke of Shrewsbury. On the other side, besides Ormond,
Harcourt, and Bolingbroke, were the Duke of Buckingham, Sir William
Wyndham, and probably Mr. Bromley.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_327" id="Footnote_327" href="#FNanchor_327"><span class="label">[327]</span></a>
 It is said that the Duke of Leeds, who was now in the Stuart interest,
had sounded her in 1711, but with no success in discovering her intention.
Macpherson, 212. The Duke of Buckingham pretended, in the above-mentioned
letter to St. Germains, June 1712, that he had often pressed
the queen on the subject of her brother's restoration, but could get no
other answer than, "you see he does not make the least step to oblige
me;" or, "he may thank himself for it: he knows I always loved him
better than the other." <i>Id.</i> 328. This alludes to the Pretender's pertinacity,
as the writer thought it, in adhering to his religion; and it may
be very questionable, whether he had ever such conversation with the
queen at all. But, if he had, it does not lead to the supposition, that under
all circumstances she meditated his restoration. If the book under the
name of Mesnager is genuine, which I much doubt, Mrs. Masham had never
been able to elicit anything decisive of her majesty's inclinations; nor do
any of the Stuart correspondents in Macpherson pretend to know her
intentions with certainty. The following passage in Lockhart seems
rather more to the purpose: On his coming to parliament in 1710, with a
"high monarchical address," which he had procured from the county of
Edinburgh, "the queen told me, though I had almost always opposed her
measures, she did not doubt of my affection to her person, and hoped I
would not concur in the design against Mrs. Masham, or for bringing over
the Prince of Hanover. At first I was somewhat surprised, but recovering
myself, I assured her I should never be accessary to the imposing any
hardship or affront upon her; and as for the Prince of Hanover, her
majesty might judge from the address I had read, that I should not be
acceptable to my constituents if I gave my consent for bringing over any
of that family, either now or at any time hereafter. At that she smiled,
and I withdrew; and then she said to the duke (Hamilton), she believed
I was an honest man and a fair dealer, and the duke replied, he could
assure her I liked her majesty and all her father's bairns."&mdash;P. 317. It
appears in subsequent parts of this book, that Lockhart and his friends
were confident of the queen's inclinations in the last year of her life, though
not of her resolution.</p>

<p class="footnote">The truth seems to be, that Anne was very dissembling, as Swift
repeatedly says in his private letters, and as feeble and timid persons in
high station generally are; that she hated the house of Hanover, and in
some measure feared them; but that she had no regard for the Pretender
(for it is really absurd to talk like Somerville of natural affection under all
the circumstances), and feared him a great deal more than the other; that
she had, however, some scruples about his right, which were counterbalanced
by her attachment to the church of England; consequently, that
she was wavering among opposite impulses, but with a predominating
timidity which would have probably kept her from any change.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_328" id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328"><span class="label">[328]</span></a>
 The Duchess of Gordon, in June 1711, sent a silver medal to the faculty
of advocates at Edinburgh, with a head on one side, and the inscription,
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cujus est</span>"; on the other, the British isles, with the word "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reddite</span>."
The dean of faculty, Dundas of Arniston, presented this medal; and there
seems reason to believe that a majority of the advocates voted for its
reception. Somerville, p. 452. Bolingbroke, in writing on the subject to
a friend, it must be owned, speaks of the proceeding with due disapprobation.
<i>Bolingbroke Correspondence</i>, i. 343. No measures, however, were
taken to mark the court's displeasure.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Nothing is more certain," says Bolingbroke in his letter to Sir William
Wyndham, perhaps the finest of his writings, "than this truth, that there
was at that time <i>no formed design</i> in the party, whatever views some
particular men might have, against his majesty's accession to the throne."&mdash;P.
22. This is in effect to confess a great deal; and in other parts of
the same letter, he makes admissions of the same kind: though he says
that he and other tories had determined, before the queen's death, to have
no connection with the Pretender, on account of his religious bigotry.
P. 111.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_329" id="Footnote_329" href="#FNanchor_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a>
 Lockhart gives us a speech of Sir William Whitelock in 1714, bitterly
inveighing against the elector of Hanover, who, he hoped, would never
come to the crown. Some of the whigs cried out on this that he should
be brought to the bar; when Whitelock said he would not recede an inch;
he hoped the queen would outlive that prince, and in comparison to her
he did not value all the princes of Germany one farthing. P. 469. Swift,
in "Some Free Thoughts upon the present State of Affairs," 1714, speaks
with much contempt of the house of Hanover and its sovereign; and
suggests, in derision, that the infant son of the electoral prince might be
invited to take up his residence in England. He pretends in this tract,
as in all his writings, to deny entirely that there was the least tendency
towards jacobitism, either in any one of the ministry, or even any eminent
individual out of it; but with so impudent a disregard of truth that I am
not perfectly convinced of his own innocence as to that intrigue. Thus,
in his "Inquiry into the Behaviour of the Queen's last Ministry," he says,
"I remember, during the late treaty of peace, discoursing at several times
with some very eminent persons of the opposite side with whom I had
long acquaintance. I asked them seriously, whether they or any of their
friends did in earnest believe, or suspect the queen or the ministry to have
any favourable regards towards the Pretender? They all confessed for
themselves that they believed nothing of the matter," etc. He then tells
us that he had the curiosity to ask almost every person in great employment,
whether they knew or had heard of any one particular man, except
professed nonjurors, that discovered the least inclination towards the
Pretender; and the whole number they could muster up did not amount
to above five or six; among whom one was a certain old lord lately dead,
and one a private gentleman, of little consequence and of a broken fortune,
etc. (vol. 15, p. 94, edit. 12mo, 1765). This acute observer of mankind
well knew that lying is frequently successful in the ratio of its effrontery
and extravagance. There are, however, some passages in this tract, as in
others written by Swift, in relation to that time, which serve to illustrate
the obscure machinations of those famous last years of the queen.</p>

 On a motion in the House of Lords that the protestant succession was
in danger, April 5, 1714, the ministry had only a majority of 76 to 69,
several bishops and other tories voting against them. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vi. 1334.
Even in the Commons the division was but 256 to 208. <i>Id.</i> 1347.</p>

 Somerville has a separate dissertation on the danger of the protestant
succession, intended to prove that it was in no danger at all, except
through the violence of the whigs in exasperating the queen. It is true
that Lockhart's <i>Commentaries</i> were not published at this time; but he had
Macpherson before him, and the <i>Memoirs of Berwick</i>, and even gave credit
to the authenticity of Mesnager, which I do not. But this sensible, and
on the whole impartial writer, had contracted an excessive prejudice
against the whigs of that period as a party, though he seems to adopt their
principles. His dissertation is a laboured attempt to explain away the
most evident facts, and to deny what no one of either party at that time
would probably have in private denied.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_332" id="Footnote_332" href="#FNanchor_332"><span class="label">[332]</span></a>
 The queen was very ill about the close of 1713; in fact it became
evident, as it had long been apprehended, that she could not live much
longer. The Hanoverians, both whigs and tories, urged that the electoral
prince should be sent for; it was thought that whichever of the competitors
should have the start upon her death would succeed in securing
the crown. Macpherson, 385, 546, 557 <i>et alibi</i>. Can there be a more
complete justification of this measure, which Somerville and the tory
writers treat as disrespectful to the queen? The Hanoverian envoy,
Schutz, demanded the writ for the electoral prince without his master's
orders; but it was done with the advice of all the whig leaders (<i>Id.</i> 592),
and with the sanction of the Electress Sophia, who died immediately after.
"All who are for Hanover believe the coming of the electoral prince to
be advantageous; all those against it are frightened at it." <i>Id.</i> 596. It
was doubtless a critical moment; and the court of Hanover might be
excused for pausing in the choice of dangers, as the step must make the
queen decidedly their enemy. She was greatly offended, and forbade the
Hanoverian minister to appear at court. Indeed she wrote to the elector,
on May 19, expressing her disapprobation of the prince's coming over to
England, and "her determination to oppose a project so contrary to her
royal authority, however fatal the consequences may be." <i>Id.</i> 621.
Oxford and Bolingbroke intimate the same. <i>Id.</i> 593; and see <i>Bolingbroke
Correspondence</i>, iv. 512, a very strong passage. The measure was given
up, whether from unwillingness on the part of George to make the queen
irreconcilable, or, as is at least equally probable, out of jealousy of his son.
The former certainly disappointed his adherents by more apparent apathy
than their ardour required; which will not be surprising, when we reflect
that, even upon the throne, he seemed to care very little about it. Macpherson,
sub ann. 1714, <i>passim</i>.</p>

 He was strongly pressed by his English adherents to declare himself a
protestant. He wrote a very good answer. Macpherson, 436. Madame
de Maintenon says, some catholics urged him to the same course, "par une
politique poussée un peu trop loin." <i>Lettres à la Princesse des Ursins</i>,

 The rage of the tory party against the queen and Lord Oxford for
retaining whigs in office is notorious from Swift's private letters, and many
other authorities. And Bolingbroke, in his letter to Sir W. Wyndham,
very fairly owns their intention "to fill the employments of the kingdom,
down to the meanest, with tories."&mdash;"We imagined," he proceeds, "that
such measures, joined to the advantages of our numbers and our property,
would secure us against all attempts during her reign; and that we should
soon become too considerable not to make our terms in all events which
might happen afterwards; concerning which, to speak truly, I believe few
or none of us had any very settled resolution." P. 11. It is rather
amusing to observe that those who called themselves the tory or church
party, seem to have fancied they had a natural right to power and profit,
so that an injury was done them when these rewards went another way;
and I am not sure that something of the same prejudice has not been
perceptible in times a good deal later.</p>

 Though no republican party, as I have elsewhere observed, could with
any propriety be said to exist, it is easy to perceive that a certain degree
of provocation from the Crown might have brought one together in no
slight force. These two propositions are perfectly compatible.</p>

 This is well put by Bishop Willis in his speech on the bill against
Atterbury. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> viii. 305. In a pamphlet, entitled "English
Advice to the Freeholders" (<i>Somers Tracts</i>, xiii. 521), ascribed to Atterbury
himself, a most virulent attack is made on the government, merely because
what he calls the church party had been thrown out of office. "Among
all who call themselves whigs," he says, "and are of any consideration as
such, name me the man I cannot prove to be an inveterate enemy to the
church of England; and I will be a convert that instant to their cause."
It must be owned perhaps that the whig ministry might better have
avoided some reflections on the late times in the addresses of both houses;
and still more, some not very constitutional recommendations to the
electors, in the proclamation calling the new parliament in 1714 <i>Parl.
Hist.</i> vi. 44, 50. "Never was prince more universally well received by
subjects than his present majesty on his arrival; and never was less done
by a prince to create a change in people's affections. But so it is, a very
observable change hath happened. Evil infusions were spread on the one
hand; and, it may be, there was too great a stoicism or contempt of
popularity on the other." "Argument to prove the Affections of the
People of England to be the best Security for the Government," p. 11
(1716). This is the pamphlet written to recommend lenity towards the
rebels, which Addison has answered in the <i>Freeholder</i>. It is invidious, and
perhaps secretly jacobite. Bolingbroke observes, in the letter already
quoted, that the Pretender's journey from Bar, in 1714, was a mere farce,
no party being ready to receive him; but "the menaces of the whigs,
backed by some very rash declarations [those of the king], and little circumstances
of humour, which frequently offend more than real injuries,
and by the entire change of all persons in employment, blew up the coals."&mdash;P.
34. Then, he owns, the tories looked to Bar. "The violence of the
whigs forced them into the arms of the Pretender." It is to be remarked
on all this, that, by Bolingbroke's own account, the tories, if they had no
"formed design" or "settled resolution" that way, were not very
determined in their repugnance before the queen's death; and that the
chief violence of which they complained was, that George chose to employ
his friends rather than his enemies.</p>

 The trials after this rebellion were not conducted with quite that
appearance of impartiality which we now exact from judges. Chief Baron
Montagu reprimanded a jury for acquitting some persons indicted for
treason; and Tindal, an historian very strongly on the court side, admits
that the dying speeches of some of the sufferers made an impression on
the people, so as to increase rather than lessen the number of jacobites.
<i>Continuation of Rapin</i>, p. 501 (folio edit.). There seems, however, upon
the whole, to have been greater and less necessary severity after the
rebellion in 1745; and upon this latter occasion it is impossible not to
reprobate the execution of Mr. Ratcliffe (brother of that Earl of Derwentwater
who had lost his head in 1716), after an absence of thirty years from
this country, to the sovereign of which he had never professed allegiance
nor could owe any, except by the fiction of our law.</p>

Joseph Jekyll strongly opposing it, though he had said before (<i>Id.</i> 67)
that they had more than sufficient evidence against Bolingbroke on the
statute of Edward III. A motion was made in the Lords, to consult the
judges whether the articles amounted to treason, but lost by 84 to 52.
<i>Id.</i> 154. Lord Cowper on this occasion challenged all the lawyers in
England to disprove that proposition. The proposal of reference to the
judges was perhaps premature; but the house must surely have done this
before their final sentence, or shown themselves more passionate than in
the case of Lord Strafford.</p>

in the whig party at this time; yet I should suppose the ministers might
have prevented this defeat, if they had been anxious to do so. It seems,
however, by a letter in Coxe's <i>Memoirs of Walpole</i>, vol. ii. p. 123, that the
government were for dropping the charge of treason against Oxford, "it
being very certain that there is not sufficient evidence to convict him of
that crime," but for pressing those of misdemeanour.</p>

 <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vi. 972. Burnet, 560, makes some observations on the vote
passed on this occasion, censuring the late ministers for advising an
offensive war in Spain. "A resolution in council is only the sovereign's
act, who upon hearing his counsellors deliver their opinions, forms his own
resolution; a counsellor may indeed be liable to censure for what he may
say at that board; but the resolution taken there has been hitherto
treated with a silent respect; but by that precedent it will be hereafter
subject to a parliamentary inquiry." Speaker Onslow justly remarks that
these general and indefinite sentiments are liable to much exception, and
that the bishop did not try them by his whig principles. The first instance
where I find the responsibility of some one for every act of the Crown
strongly laid down is in a speech of the Duke of Argyle, in 1739. <i>Parl.
Hist.</i> ix. 1138. "It is true," he says, "the nature of our constitution
requires that public acts should be issued out in his majesty's name; but
for all that, my lords, he is not the author of them."</p>

 "Lord Bolingbroke used to say that the restraining orders to the Duke
of Ormond were proposed in the cabinet council, in the queen's presence,
by the Earl of Oxford, who had not communicated his intention to the
rest of the ministers; and that Lord Bolingbroke was on the point of
giving his opinion against it, when the queen, without suffering the matter
to be debated, directed these orders to be sent, and broke up the council.
This story was told by the late Lord Bolingbroke to my father." Note
by Lord Hardwicke on Burnet (Oxf. edit. vi. 119). The noble annotator
has given us the same anecdote in the <i>Hardwicke State Papers</i>, ii. 482; but
with this variance, that Lord Bolingbroke there ascribes the orders to the
queen herself, though he conjectured them to have proceeded from Lord
Oxford.</p>

this step, might go on still farther to protract its own duration, was not
quite idle. We find from Coxe's <i>Memoirs of Walpole</i>, ii. 217, that in 1720,
when the first septennial House of Commons had nearly run its term, there
was a project of once more prolonging its life.</p>

<p class="footnote">Lord Sunderland held out, by way of inducements to the bill, that the
Lords would part with <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandalum magnatum</span></i>, and permit the Commons
to administer an oath; and that the king would give up the prerogative
of pardoning after an impeachment. Coxe's <i>Walpole</i>, ii. 172. Mere trifles,

 The letters in Coxe's <i>Memoirs of Walpole</i>, vol. ii., abundantly show the
German nationality, the impolicy and neglect of his duties, the rapacity
and petty selfishness of George I. The whigs were much dissatisfied; but
fear of losing their places made them his slaves. Nothing can be more
demonstrable than that the king's character was the main cause of preserving
jacobitism, as that of his competitor was of weakening it.</p>

<p class="footnote">The habeas corpus was several times suspended in this reign, as it had
been in that of William. Though the perpetual conspiracies of the
jacobites afforded a sufficient apology for this measure, it was invidiously
held up as inconsistent with a government which professed to stand on the
principles of liberty. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> v. 153, 267, 604; vii. 276; viii. 38.
But some of these suspensions were too long, especially the last, from
October 1722 to October 1723. Sir Joseph Jekyll, with his usual zeal for
liberty, moved to reduce the time to six months.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_348" id="Footnote_348" href="#FNanchor_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a>
 "It was first settled by a verbal agreement between Archbishop
Sheldon and the Lord Chancellor Clarendon, and tacitly given into by the
clergy in general as a great ease to them in taxations. The first public act
of any kind relating to it was an act of parliament in 1665, by which the
clergy were, in common with the laity, charged with the tax given in that
act, and were discharged from the payment of the subsidies they had
granted before in convocation; but in this act of parliament of 1665 there
is an express saving of the right of the clergy to tax themselves in convocation,
if they think fit; but that has been never done since, nor attempted,
as I know of, and the clergy have been constantly from that time charged
with laity in all public aids to the Crown by the House of Commons. In
consequence of this (but from what period I cannot say), without the
intervention of any particular law for it, except what I shall mention
presently, the clergy (who are not lords of parliament) have assumed, and
without any objection enjoyed, the privilege of voting in the election of
members of the House of Commons, in virtue of their ecclesiastical freeholds.
This has constantly been practised from the time it first began;
there are two acts of parliament which suppose it to be now a right. The
acts are 10 Anne, c. 23; 18 Geo. II. c. 18. Gibson, Bishop of London,
said to me, that this (the taxation of the clergy out of convocation) was
the greatest alteration in the constitution ever made without an express
law." Speaker Onslow's note on Burnet (Oxf. edit. iv. 508).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_349" id="Footnote_349" href="#FNanchor_349"><span class="label">[349]</span></a>
 The first authority I have observed for this pretension is an address
of the House of Lords (19 Nov. 1675) to the throne, for the frequent
meeting of the convocation, and that they do make to the king such
representations as may be for the safety of the religion established. Lords'
Journals. This address was renewed February 22, 1677. But what took
place in consequence I am not apprised. It shows, however, some degree
of dissatisfaction on the part of the bishops, who must be presumed to
have set forward these addresses, at the virtual annihilation of their synod
which naturally followed from its relinquishment of self-taxation.</p>

 The lower house of convocation, in the late reign, among their other
vagaries, had requested "that some synodical notice might be taken of
the dishonour done to the church by a sermon preached by Mr. Benjamin
Hoadley at St. Lawrence Jewry, Sept. 29, 1705, containing positions
contrary to the doctrine of the church, expressed in the first and second
parts of the homily against disobedience and wilful rebellion." Wilkins,

 These qualities are so apparent, that after turning over some forty or
fifty tracts, and consuming a good many hours on the Bangorian controversy,
I should find some difficulty in stating with precision the propositions
in dispute. It is, however, evident that a dislike, not perhaps exactly
to the house of Brunswick, but to the tenor of George I.'s administration,
and to Hoadley himself as an eminent advocate for it, who had been
rewarded accordingly, was at the bottom a leading motive with most of
the church party; some of whom, such as Hare, though originally of a
whig connection, might have had disappointments to exasperate them.</p>

<p class="footnote">There was nothing whatever in Hoadley's sermon injurious to the
established endowments and privileges, nor to the discipline and government,
of the English church, even in theory. If this had been the case,
he might be reproached with some inconsistency in becoming so large a
partaker of her honours and emoluments. He even admitted the usefulness
of censures for open immoralities, though denying all church authority to
oblige any one to external communion, or to pass any sentence which
should determine the condition of men with respect to the favour or displeasure
of God. Hoadley's Works, ii. 465, 493. Another great question
in this controversy was that of religious liberty, as a civil right, which the
convocation explicitly denied. And another related to the much debated
exercise of private judgment in religion, which, as one party meant virtually
to take away, so the other perhaps unreasonably exaggerated. Some other
disputes arose in the course of the combat, particularly the delicate
problem of the value of sincerity as a plea for material errors.</p>

one way or other. "Though the Earl of Oxford voted for it himself, he

It was repeated next year, intermitted the next, and afterwards renewed
in every year of that reign except the fifth, the seventeenth, the twenty-second,

these occasional interruptions were intended to prevent the nonconformists
from relying upon it, or were caused by some accidental circumstance,
must be left to conjecture. I believe that the renewal has been
regular every year since the accession of George III. It is to be remembered,
that the present work was first published before the repeal of the

 We find in Gutch's <i>Collectanea Curiosa</i>, vol. i. p. 53, a plan, ascribed to
Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, for taking away the election of heads of
colleges from the fellows, and vesting the nomination in the great officers
of state, in order to cure the disaffection and want of discipline which was
justly complained of. This remedy would have been perhaps the substitution
of a permanent for a temporary evil. It appears also that
Archbishop Wake wanted to have had a bill, in 1716, for asserting the
royal supremacy, and better regulating the clergy of the two universities
(Coxe's <i>Walpole</i>, ii. 122); but I do not know that the precise nature of this
is anywhere mentioned. I can scarcely quote Amherst's <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ Filius</span></i> as
authority; it is a very clever, though rather libellous, invective against
the university of Oxford at that time; but from internal evidence, as well
as the confirmation which better authorities afford it, I have no doubt
that it contains much truth.</p>

<p class="footnote">Those who have looked much at the ephemeral literature of these two
reigns must be aware of many publications fixing the charge of prevalent
disaffection on this university, down to the death of George II.; and
Dr. King, the famous jacobite master of St. Mary Hall, admits that some
were left to reproach him for apostasy in going to court on the accession
of the late king in 1760. The general reader will remember the <i>Isis</i> by
Mason, and the <i>Triumph of Isis</i> by Warton; the one a severe invective,
the other an indignant vindication; but in this instance, notwithstanding
the advantages which satire is supposed to have over panegyric, we must
award the laurel to the worse cause, and, what is more extraordinary, to
the worse poet.</p>

 Layer, who suffered on account of this plot, had accused several peers,
among others Lord Cowper, who complained to the house of the publication
of his name; and indeed, though he was at that time strongly in opposition
to the court, the charge seems wholly incredible. Lord Strafford, however,
was probably guilty; Lords North and Orrery certainly so. <i>Parl. Hist.</i>

words, "in the latter part of his life had entered into correspondencies and
designs, which would have been fatal to himself or to the public."&mdash;P. 657.
This is mentioned by Coxe, i. 165; and certainly confirmed by Lockhart,
ii. 68, 70. But the reader will hardly give credit to such a story as Horace
Walpole has told, that he coolly consulted Sir Robert, his political rival,
as to the part they should take on the king's death. Lord Orford's

Hoadley, who was no orator, published two letters in the newspaper,
signed "Britannicus," in answer to Atterbury's defence; which, after all
that had passed, he might better have spared. Atterbury's own speech is
certainly below his fame, especially the peroration. <i>Id.</i> 267.</p>

<p class="footnote">No one, I presume, will affect to doubt the reality of Atterbury's connections
with the Stuart family, either before his attainder or during his
exile. The proofs of the latter were published by Lord Hailes in 1768,
and may be found also in Nicholls's edition of Atterbury's <i>Correspondence</i>,

 The tories, it is observed in the MS. journal of Mr. Yorke (second Earl
of Hardwicke), showed no sign of affection to the government at the time
when the invasion was expected in 1743, but treated it all with indifference.
<i>Parl. Hist.</i> xiii. 668. In fact a disgraceful apathy pervaded the nation;
and according to a letter from Mr. Fox to Mr. Winnington in 1745, which
I only quote from recollection, it seemed perfectly uncertain, from this
general passiveness, whether the revolution might not be suddenly brought
about. Yet very few comparatively, I am persuaded, had the slightest
attachment or prejudice in favour of the house of Stuart; but the continual
absence from England, and the Hanoverian predilections of the two
Georges, the feebleness and factiousness of their administration, and of
public men in general, and an indefinite opinion of misgovernment, raised
through the press, though certainly without oppression or arbitrary acts,
had gradually alienated the mass of the nation. But this would not lead
men to expose their lives and fortunes; and hence the people of England, a
thing almost incredible, lay quiet and nearly unconcerned, while the little
army of Highlanders came every day nearer to the capital. It is absurd,
however, to suppose that they could have been really successful by marching
onward; though their defeat might have been more glorious at
Finchley than at Culloden.</p>

Edward's behaviour in refusing to quit France after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.

hand and foot; an outrage which even his preposterous conduct could
hardly excuse.</p>

<p class="footnote">Dr. King was in correspondence with this prince for some years after the
latter's foolish, though courageous, visit to London in September 1750;
which he left again in five days, on finding himself deceived by some
sanguine friends. King says he was wholly ignorant of our history and
constitution. "I never heard him express any noble or benevolent
sentiment, the certain indications of a great soul and good heart; or
discover any sorrow or compassion for the misfortune of so many worthy
men who had suffered in his cause." <i>Anecdotes of his own Times</i>, p. 201.
He goes on to charge him with love of money and other faults. But his
great folly in keeping a mistress, Mrs. Walkinshaw, whose sister was housekeeper
at Leicester House, alarmed the jacobites. "These were all men
of fortune and distinction, and many of them persons of the first quality,
who attached themselves to the P. as to a person who they imagined might
be made the instrument of saving their country. They were sensible that
by Walpole's administration the English government was become a
system of corruption; and that Walpole's successors, who pursued his plan
without any of his abilities, had reduced us to such a deplorable situation
that our commercial interest was sinking, our colonies in danger of being
lost, and Great Britain, which, if her powers were properly exerted, as they
were afterwards in Mr. Pitt's administration, was able to give laws to other
nations, was become the contempt of all Europe."&mdash;P. 208. This is in
truth the secret of the continuance of jacobitism. But possibly that party
were not sorry to find a pretext for breaking off so hopeless a connection,
which they seem to have done about 1755. Mr. Pitt's great successes
reconciled them to the administration; and his liberal conduct brought
back those who had been disgusted by an exclusive policy. On the
accession of a new king they flocked to St. James's; and probably scarcely
one person of the rank of a gentleman, south of the Tweed, was found
to dispute the right of the house of Brunswick after 1760. Dr. King himself,
it may be observed, laughs at the old passive obedience doctrine (page 193);
so far was he from being a jacobite of that school.</p>

<p class="footnote">A few nonjuring congregations lingered on far into the reign of George
III., presided over by the successors of some bishops whom Lloyd of
Norwich, the last of those deprived at the revolution, had consecrated in
order to keep up the schism. A list of these is given in D'Oyly's <i>Life of
Sancroft</i>, vol. ii. p. 34, whence it would appear that the last of them died
in 1779. I can trace the line a little farther: a bishop of that separation,
named Cartwright, resided at Shrewsbury in 1793, carrying on the business
of a surgeon. <i>State Trials</i>, xxiii. 1073. I have heard of similar congregations
in the west of England still later. He had, however, become a very
loyal subject to King George: a singular proof of that tenacity of life by
which religious sects, after dwindling down through neglect, excel frogs
and tortoises; and that, even when they have become almost equally
cold-blooded!</p>

 The military having been called in to quell an alleged riot at Westminster
election in 1741, it was resolved (Dec. 22nd) "that the presence
of a regular body of armed soldiers at an election of members to serve in
parliament is a high infringement of the liberties of the subject, a manifest
violation of the freedom of elections, and an open defiance of the laws and
constitution of this kingdom." The persons concerned in this, having
been ordered to attend the house, received on their knees a very severe
reprimand from the speaker. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> ix. 326. Upon some occasion,

 By the act of 6 Anne, c. 7, all persons holding pensions from the Crown
during pleasure were made incapable of sitting in the House of Commons;
which was extended by 1 Geo. I. c. 56, to those who held them for any
term of years. But the difficulty was to ascertain the fact; the government
refusing information. Mr. Sandys, accordingly proposed a bill in
1730, by which every member of the Commons was to take an oath that he
did not hold any such pension, and that, in case of accepting one, he would
disclose it to the house within fourteen days. This was carried by a small
majority through the Commons, but rejected in the other house; which
happened again in 1734 and in 1740. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> viii. 789; ix. 369; xi. 510.

fatal counsel of putting off the meeting of a parliament so long, and to
unnecessary delays of the House of Commons. Lords' Journals, 23rd

ill consequences which may at this time attend the delay of the supplies
granted by the Commons for the preserving the public peace, and maintaining

an indemnity for their own enormous crimes, have used their utmost

who generally affects to take the popular side, inveighs against this

arising out of a dislike to the king, is very manifest throughout the second

 <i>History of the Kentish Petition</i>; <i>Somers Tracts</i>, xi. 242; <i>Legion's Paper</i>;
<i>Id.</i> 264; <i>Vindication of the Rights of the Commons</i> (either by Harley or Sir
Humphrey Mackworth); <i>Id.</i> 276. This contains in many respects constitutional
principles; but the author holds very strong language about
the right of petitioning. After quoting the statute of Charles II. against
tumults on pretence of presenting petitions, he says: "By this statute it
may be observed, that not only the number of persons is restrained, but
the occasion also for which they may petition; which is for the alteration
of matters established in church or state, for want whereof some inconvenience
may arise to that county from which the petition shall be brought.
For it is plain by the express words and meaning of that statute that the
grievance or matter of the petition must arise in the same county as the
petition itself. They may indeed petition the king for a parliament to
redress their grievances; and they may petition that parliament to make
one law that is advantageous, and repeal another that is prejudicial to the
trade or interest of that county; but they have no power by this statute,
nor by the constitution of the English government, to direct the parliament
in the general proceedings concerning the whole kingdom; for the law
declares that a general consultation of all the wise representatives of
parliament is more for the safety of England than the hasty advice of a
number of petitioners of a private county, of a grand jury, or of a few
justices of the peace, who seldom have a true state of the case represented
to them."&mdash;P. 313.</p>

<p class="footnote">These are certainly what must appear in the present day very strange
limitations of the subject's right to petition either house of parliament.
But it is really true that such a right was not generally recognised, nor
frequently exercised, in so large an extent as is now held unquestionable.
We may search whole volumes of the journals, while the most animating
topics were in discussion, without finding a single instance of such an
interposition of the constituent with the representative body. In this
particular case of the Kentish petition, the words in the resolution, that it
tended to destroy the constitution of parliament and subvert the established
government, could be founded on no pretence but its unusual interference
with the counsels of the legislature. With this exception, I am not aware
(stating this, however, with some diffidence) of any merely political petition
before the Septennial bill in 1717, against which several were presented
from corporate towns; one of which was rejected on account of language
that the house thought indecent; and as to these it may be observed, that
towns returning members to parliament had a particular concern in the
measure before the house. They relate, however, no doubt, to general
policy, and seem to establish a popular principle which stood on little
authority. I do not of course include the petitions to the long parliament
in 1640, nor one addressed to the Convention, in 1689, from the inhabitants
of London and Westminster, pressing their declaration of William and
Mary; both in times too critical to furnish regular precedents. But as the
popular principles of government grew more established, the right of
petitioning on general grounds seems to have been better recognised; and
instances may be found, during the administration of Sir Robert Walpole,
though still by no means frequent. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> xii. 119. The city of
London presented a petition against the bill for naturalisation of the Jews,
in 1753, as being derogatory to the Christian religion as well as detrimental
to trade. <i>Id.</i> xiv. 1417. It caused, however, some animadversion; for
Mr. Northey, in the debate next session on the proposal to repeal this bill,
alluding to this very petition, and to the comments Mr. Pelham made on
it, as "so like the famous Kentish petition that if they had been treated
in the same manner it would have been what they deserved," observes
in reply, that the "right of petitioning either the king or the parliament
in a decent and submissive manner, and without any riotous appearance
against anything they think may affect their religion and liberties, will
never, I hope, be taken from the subject." <i>Id.</i> xv. 149; see also 376.
And it is very remarkable that notwithstanding the violent clamour excited
by that unfortunate statute, no petitions for its repeal are to be found in
the journals. They are equally silent with regard to the marriage act,
another topic of popular obloquy. Some petitions appear to have been
presented against the bill for naturalisation of foreign protestants; but
probably on the ground of its injurious effect on the parties themselves.
The great multiplication of petitions on matters wholly unconnected with
particular interests cannot, I believe, be traced higher than those for the
abolition of the slave trade in 1787; though a few were presented for
reform about the end of the American war, which would undoubtedly have
been rejected with indignation in any earlier stage of our constitution. It
may be remarked also that petitions against bills imposing duties are not
received, probably on the principle that they are intended for the general
interests, though affecting the parties who thus complain of them. Hatsell,
iii. 200.</p>

<p class="footnote">The convocation of public meetings for the debate of political questions,
as preparatory to such addresses or petitions, is still less according to the
practice and precedents of our ancestors; nor does it appear that the
sheriffs or other magistrates are more invested with a right of convening
or presiding in assemblies of this nature than any other persons; though,
within the bounds of the public peace, it would not perhaps be contended
that they have ever been unlawful. But that their origin can be distinctly
traced higher than the year 1769, I am not prepared to assert. It will of
course be understood, that this note is merely historical, and without
reference to the expediency of that change in our constitutional theory
which it illustrates.</p>

 This is very elaborately and dispassionately argued by Mr. Hargrave
in his <i>Juridical Arguments</i>, above cited; also vol. ii. p. 183. "I understand
it," he says, "to be clearly part of the law and custom of parliament
that each house of parliament may inquire into and imprison for breaches
of privilege." But this he thinks to be limited by law; and after allowing
it clearly in cases of obstruction, arrest, assault, etc., on members, admits
also that "the judicative power as to writing, speaking, or publishing,
of gross reflections upon the whole parliament or upon either house,
though perhaps originally questionable, seems now of too long a standing
and of too much frequency in practice to be well counteracted." But
after mentioning the opinions of the judges in Crosby's case, Mr. H.
observes: "I am myself far from being convinced that commitment for
contempts by a house of parliament, or by the highest court of judicature
in Westminster Hall, either ought to be, or are thus wholly privileged from
all examination and appeal."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_402" id="Footnote_402" href="#FNanchor_402"><span class="label">[402]</span></a>
 Mr. Justice Gould, in Crosby's case, as reported by Wilson, observes:
"It is true this court did, in the instance alluded to by the counsel at the
bar (Wilkes's case, 2 Wilson, 151), determine upon the privilege of parliament
in the case of a libel; but then that privilege was promulged and
known; it existed in records and law-books, and was allowed by parliament
itself. But <i>even in that case we now know that we were mistaken; for the
House of Commons have since determined, that privilege does not extend to
matters of libel</i>." It appears, therefore, that Mr. Justice Gould thought a
declaration of the House of Commons was better authority than a decision
of the court of common pleas, as to a privilege which, as he says, existed
in records and law-books.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_403" id="Footnote_403" href="#FNanchor_403"><span class="label">[403]</span></a>
 "I am far from subscribing to all the latitude of the doctrine of
attachments for contempts of the king's courts of Westminster, especially
the King's Bench, as it is sometimes stated, and it has been sometimes
practised." Hargrave, ii. 213.</p>

<p class="footnote">"The principle upon which attachments issue for libels on courts is of
a more enlarged and important nature: it is <i>to keep a blaze of glory around
them</i>, and to deter people from attempting to render them contemptible in
the eyes of the people." Wilmot's <i>Opinions and Judgments</i>, p. 270. Yet
the king, who seems as much entitled to this blaze of glory as his judges,
is driven to the verdict of a jury before the most libellous insult on him
can be punished.</p>

 This effect of continual new statutes is well pointed out in a speech
ascribed to Sir William Wyndham in 1734: "The learned gentleman spoke
(he says) of the prerogative of the Crown, and asked us if it had lately been
extended beyond the bounds prescribed to it by law. Sir, I will not say
that there have been lately any attempts to extend it beyond the bounds
prescribed by law; but I will say that these bounds have been of late so
vastly enlarged that there seems to be no great occasion for any such
attempt. What are the many penal laws made within these forty years,
but so many extensions of the prerogative of the Crown, and as many
diminutions of the liberty of the subject? And whatever the necessity
was that brought us into the enacting of such laws, it was a fatal necessity;
it has greatly added to the power of the Crown, and particular care ought
to be taken not to throw any more weight into that scale." <i>Parl. Hist.</i>
ix. 463.</p>

<p class="footnote">Among the modern statutes which have strengthened the hands of the
executive power, we should mention the riot act (1 Geo. I. stat. 2, c. 5),
whereby all persons tumultuously assembled to the disturbance of the
public peace, and not dispersing within one hour after proclamation made
by a single magistrate, are made guilty of a capital felony. I am by no
means controverting the expediency of this law; but, especially when
combined with the aid of a military force, it is surely a compensation for
much that may seem to have been thrown into the popular scale.</p>

 Coxe's <i>Walpole</i>, i. 296; H. Walpole's Works, iv. 476. The former,
however, seems to rest on H. Walpole's verbal communication, whose
want of accuracy, or veracity, or both, is so palpable that no great stress
can be laid on his testimony. I believe, however, that the fact of George I.
and his minister conversing in Latin may be proved on other authority.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_408" id="Footnote_408" href="#FNanchor_408"><span class="label">[408]</span></a>
 H. Walpole's <i>Memoirs of the last Ten Years</i>; Lord Waldegrave's
<i>Memoirs</i>. In this well written little book, the character of George II. in
reference to his constitutional position, is thus delicately drawn: "He
has more knowledge of foreign affairs than most of his ministers, and has
good general notions of the constitution, strength, and interest of this
country; but, being past thirty when the Hanover succession took place,
and having since experienced the violence of party, the injustice of popular
clamour, the corruption of parliaments, and the selfish motives of pretended
patriots, it is not surprising that he should have contracted some
prejudices in favour of those governments where the royal authority is
under less restraint. Yet prudence has so far prevailed over these
prejudices, that they have never influenced his conduct. On the contrary,
many laws have been enacted in favour of public liberty; and in the course
of a long reign there has not been a single attempt to extend the prerogative
of the Crown beyond its proper limits. He has as much personal bravery
as any man, though his political courage seems somewhat problematical;
however, it is a fault on the right side; for had he always been as firm and
undaunted in the closet as he showed himself at Oudenarde and Dettingen,
he might not have proved quite so good a king in this limited monarchy,"&mdash;P.
5. This was written in 1757.</p>

<p class="footnote">The real tories, those I mean who adhered to the principles expressed
by that name, thought the constitutional prerogative of the Crown
impaired by a conspiracy of its servants. Their notions are expressed in
some "Letters on the English Nation," published about 1756, under the
name of Battista Angeloni, by Dr. Shebbeare, once a jacobite, and still so
bitter an enemy of William III. and George I. that he stood in the pillory,
not long afterwards, for a libel on those princes (among other things); on
which Horace Walpole justly animadverts, as a stretch of the law by Lord
Mansfield destructive of all historical truth. <i>Memoirs of the last Ten
Years</i>, ii. 328. Shebbeare, however, was afterwards pensioned, along with
Johnson, by Lord Bute, and at the time when these letters were written,
may possibly have been in the Leicester House interest. Certain it is, that
the self-interested cabal who belonged to that little court endeavoured too
successfully to persuade its chief and her son that the Crown was reduced
to a state of vassalage, from which it ought to be emancipated; and the
government of the Duke of Newcastle, as strong in party connection as it

 Many proofs of this occur in the correspondence published by Mr. Coxe.
Thus Horace Walpole writing to his brother Sir Robert, in 1739, says:
"King William had no other object but the liberties and balance of Europe;
but, good God! what is the case now? I will tell you in confidence; little,
low, partial, electoral notions are able to stop or confound the best conducted
project for the public." <i>Memoirs of Sir R. Walpole</i>, iii. 535. The
Walpoles had, some years before, disapproved the policy of Lord Townshend
on account of his favouring the king's Hanoverian prejudices.
<i>Id.</i> i. 334. And, in the preceding reign, both these whig leaders were
extremely disgusted with the Germanism and continual absence of
George I. (<i>Id.</i> ii. 116, 297), though first Townshend, and afterwards
Walpole, according to the necessity, or supposed necessity, which controls
statesmen (that is, the fear of losing their places), became in appearance
the passive instruments of royal pleasure.</p>

<p class="footnote">It is now, however, known that George II. had been induced by Walpole
to come into a scheme, by which Hanover, after his decease, was to be
separated from England. It stands on the indisputable authority of
Speaker Onslow. "A little while before Sir Robert Walpole's fall (and
as a popular act to save himself, for he went very unwillingly out of his
offices and power), he took me one day aside, and said, 'What will you
say, speaker, if this hand of mine shall bring a message from the king to
the House of Commons, declaring his consent to having any of his family,
after his death, to be made, by act of parliament, incapable of inheriting
and enjoying the crown, and possessing the electoral dominions at the same
time?' My answer was, 'Sir, it will be as a message from heaven.' He
replied, 'It will be done.' But it was not done; and I have good reason
to believe, it would have been opposed, and rejected at that time, because
it came from him, and by the means of those who had always been most
clamorous for it; and thus perhaps the opportunity was lost: when will it
come again? It was said that the prince at that juncture would have
consented to it, if he could have had the credit and popularity of the
measure, and that some of his friends were to have moved it in parliament,
but that the design at St. James's prevented it. Notwithstanding all this,
I have had some thoughts that neither court ever really intended the thing
itself; but that it came on and went off, by a jealousy of each other in it,
and that both were equally pleased that it did so, from an equal fondness
(very natural) for their own native country." <i>Notes on Burnet</i> (iv. 490,
Oxf. edit.). This story has been told before, but not in such a manner as
to preclude doubt of its authenticity.</p>

 A bill was brought in for this purpose in 1712, which Swift, in his
<i>History of the Last Four Years</i>, who never printed anything with his name,
naturally blames. It miscarried, probably on account of this provision.
<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vi. 1141. But the queen, on opening the session, in April 1713,
recommended some new law to check the licentiousness of the press.

 Bolingbroke's letter to the <i>Examiner</i>, in 1710, excited so much attention
that it was answered by Lord Cowper, then chancellor, in a letter to the
<i>Tatler</i> (<i>Somers Tracts</i>, xiii. 75), where Sir Walter Scott justly observes,
that the fact of two such statesmen becoming the correspondents of
periodical publications shows the influence they must have acquired over
the public mind.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_412" id="Footnote_412" href="#FNanchor_412"><span class="label">[412]</span></a>
 It was resolved, <i>nem. con.</i>, Feb. 26th, 1729, That it is an indignity to,
and a breach of the privilege of, this house, for any person to presume to
give, in written or printed newspapers, any account or minutes of the
debates, or other proceedings of this house or of any committee thereof;
and that upon discovery of the authors, etc., this house will proceed against
the offenders with the utmost severity. <i>Parl. Hist.</i> viii. 683. There are
former resolutions to the same effect. The speaker having himself brought
the subject under consideration some years afterwards, in 1738, the
resolution was repeated in nearly the same words, but after a debate
wherein, though no one undertook to defend the practice, the danger of
impairing the liberty of the press was more insisted upon than would
formerly have been usual; and Sir Robert Walpole took credit to himself,
justly enough, for respecting it more than his predecessors. <i>Id.</i> x. 800;
Coxe's <i>Walpole</i>, i. 572. Edward Cave, the well-known editor of the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and the publisher of another magazine, was brought
to the bar, April 30th, 1747, for publishing the house's debates; when the
former denied that he retained any person in pay to make the speeches,
and after expressing his contrition was discharged on payment of fees.

the city of London and several other places petitioning against it. Journals,
Nov. 21, etc. The house refused to let some of these petitions be read;
I suppose on the ground that they related to a matter of general policy.
These towns, however, had a very fair pretext for alleging that they were
interested; and in fact a rider was added to the bill, that any merchant
might serve for a place where he should be himself a voter, on making oath
that he was worth £5000. <i>Id.</i> Dec. 19.</p>

 In a statute of James II. (1440) "the three estates conclude <i>that it is
speedful</i> that our sovereign lord the king ride throughout the realm
incontinent as shall be seen to the council where any rebellion, slaughter,
burning, robbery, outrage, or theft has happened," etc. Statutes of
Scotland, ii. 32. Pinkerton (i. 192), leaving out the words in italics, has
argued on false premises. "In this singular decree we find the legislative
body regarding the king in the modern light of a chief magistrate, bound
equally with the meanest subject to obedience to the laws," etc. It is
evident that the estates spoke in this instance as counsellors, not as
legislators. This is merely an oversight of a very well-informed historian,
who is by no means in the trammels of any political theory.</p>

<p class="footnote">A remarkable expression, however, is found in a statute of the same
king, in 1450; which enacts that any man rising in war against the king,
or receiving such as have committed treason, or holding houses against the
king, or assaulting castles or places where the king's power shall happen
to be, <i>without the consent of the three estates</i>, shall be punished as a traitor.
Pinkerton i. 213. I am inclined to think that the legislators had in view
the possible recurrence of what had very lately happened, that an ambitious
cabal might get the king's person into their power. The peculiar circumstances
of Scotland are to be taken into account when we consider these
statutes, which are not to be looked at as mere insulated texts.</p>

 I have read a good deal on this celebrated controversy; but, where so
much is disputed, it is not easy to form an opinion on every point. But,
upon the whole, I think there are only two hypotheses that can be advanced
with any colour of reason. The first is, that the murder of Darnley was
projected by Bothwell, Maitland, and some others, without the queen's
express knowledge, but with a reliance on her passion for the former, which
would lead her both to shelter him from punishment, and to raise him to
her bed; and that, in both respects, this expectation was fully realised
by a criminal connivance at the escape of one whom she must believe to
have been concerned in her husband's death, and by a still more infamous
marriage with him. This, it appears to me, is a conclusion that may be
drawn by reasoning on admitted facts, according to the common rules of
presumptive evidence. The second supposition is, that she had given a
previous consent to the assassination. This is rendered probable by
several circumstances, and especially by the famous letters and sonnets,
the genuineness of which has been so warmly disputed. I must confess
that they seem to me authentic, and that Mr. Laing's dissertation on
the murder of Darnley has rendered Mary's innocence, even as to participation
in that crime, an untenable proposition. No one of any weight, I
believe, has asserted it since his time except Dr. Lingard, who manages the
evidence with his usual adroitness, but by admitting the general authenticity
of the letters, qualified by a mere conjecture of interpolations, has
given up what his predecessors deemed the very key of the citadel.</p>

<p class="footnote">I shall dismiss a subject so foreign to my purpose, with remarking a
fallacy which affects almost the whole argument of Mary's most strenuous
advocates. They seem to fancy that, if the Earls of Murray and Morton,
and Secretary Maitland of Lethington, can be proved to have been concerned
in Darnley's murder, the queen herself is at once absolved. But
it is generally agreed that Maitland was one of those who conspired with
Bothwell for this purpose; and Morton, if he were not absolutely consenting,
was by his own acknowledgment at his execution apprised of the
conspiracy. With respect to Murray indeed there is not a shadow of
evidence, nor had he any probable motive to second Bothwell's schemes;
but, even if his participation were presumed, it would not alter in the
slightest degree the proofs as to the queen.</p>

 The Gowrie conspiracy is well known to be one of the most difficult
problems in history. Arnot has given a very good account of it (p. 20),
and shown its truth, which could not reasonably be questioned, whatever
motive we may assign for it. He has laid stress on Logan's letters, which
appear to have been unaccountably slighted by some writers. I have long
had a suspicion, founded on these letters, that the Earl of Bothwell, a
daring man of desperate fortunes, was in some manner concerned in the
plot, of which the Earl of Gowrie and his brother were the instruments.</p>

he was not charged for saying mass, nor for seducing the people to popery,
nor for anything that concerned his conscience; but for declining the
king's authority, and maintaining treasonable opinions, as the statutes
libelled on made it treason not to answer the king or his council in any
matter which should be demanded.</p>

<p class="footnote">It was one of the most monstrous iniquities of a monstrous jurisprudence,
the Scots criminal law, to debar a prisoner from any defence inconsistent
with the indictment; that is, he might deny a fact, but was not permitted
to assert that, being true, it did not warrant the conclusion of guilt.

 The practice observed in summoning or dissolving the great national
assembly of the church of Scotland, which, according to the presbyterian
theory, can only be done by its own authority, is rather amusing. "The
moderator dissolves the assembly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
the head of the church; and, by the same authority, appoints another to
meet on a certain day of the ensuing year. The lord high commissioner
then dissolves the assembly in the name of the king, and appoints another
to meet on the same day." Arnot's <i>Hist. of Edinburgh</i>, p. 269. I am
inclined to suspect, but with no very certain recollection of what I have
been told, that Arnot has misplaced the order in which this is done, and
that the lord commissioner is the first to speak. In the course of debate,
however, no regard is paid to him, all speeches being addressed to the
moderator.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_460" id="Footnote_460" href="#FNanchor_460"><span class="label">[460]</span></a>
 The king's instructions by no means warrant the execution, especially
with all its circumstances of cruelty, but they contain one unfortunate
sentence: "If Maclean [sic], of Glencoe, and that tribe can be well
separated from the rest, it will be a proper vindication of the public justice
to extirpate that seat of thieves." This was written, it is to be remembered,
while they were exposed to the penalties of the law for the rebellion.
But the massacre would never have been perpetrated, if Lord Breadalbane
and the master of Stair, two of the worst men in Scotland, had not used
the foulest arts to effect it. It is an apparent great reproach to the government
of William, that they escaped with impunity; but political necessity
bears down justice and honour. Laing, iv. 246; Carstares' <i>State Papers</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_461" id="Footnote_461" href="#FNanchor_461"><span class="label">[461]</span></a>
 Those who took the oaths were allowed to continue in their churches
without compliance with the presbyterian discipline, and many more who
not only refused the oaths but prayed openly for James and his family.
Carstares, p. 40. But in 1693 an act for settling the peace and quiet of the
church ordains, that no person be admitted or continued to be a minister
or preacher unless he have taken the oath of allegiance, and subscribed the
assurance that he held the king to be <i>de facto et de jure</i>, and also the confession
of faith; and that he owns and acknowledges presbyterian church-government
to be the only government of this church, and that he will
submit thereto and concur therewith, and will never endeavour, directly
or indirectly, the prejudice or subversion thereof. <i>Id.</i> 715; Laing, iv. 255.</p>

<p class="footnote">This act seems not to have been strictly insisted upon; and the episcopal
clergy, though their advocates did not forget to raise a cry of persecution,
which was believed in England, are said to have been treated with singular
favour. De Foe challenges them to show any one minister that ever was
deposed for not acknowledging the church, if at the same time he offered
to acknowledge the government and take the oaths; and says they have
been often challenged on this head. <i>Hist. of Church of Scotland</i>, p. 319.
In fact, a statute was passed in 1695, which confirmed all ministers who
would qualify themselves by taking the oaths: and no less than 116
(according to Laing, iv. 259) did so continue; nay, De Foe reckons 165 at
the time of the union. P. 320.</p>

<p class="footnote">The rigid presbyterians inveighed against any toleration, as much as
they did against the king's authority over their own church. But the
government paid little attention to their bigotry; besides the above-mentioned
episcopal clergymen, those who seceded from the church, though
universally jacobites, and most dangerously so, were indulged with
meeting-houses in all towns; and by an act of the queen (10 Anne, c. 7)
obtained a full toleration, on condition of praying for the royal family,
with which they never complied. It was thought necessary to put them
under some fresh restrictions in 1748, their zeal for the Pretender being
notorious and universal, by an act 21 Geo. II., c. 34; which has very
properly been repealed after the motive for it had wholly ceased, and even
at first was hardly reconcilable with the general principles of religious
liberty; though it ill becomes those to censure it who vindicate the penal
laws of Elizabeth against popery.</p>

 Archbishop Tenison said, in the debates on the union, he thought the
narrow notions of all churches had been their ruin, and that he believed
the church of Scotland to be as true a protestant church as the church of
England, though he could not say it was as perfect. Carstares, 759. This
sort of language was encouraging; but the exclusive doctrine, or <i>jus

It is remarkable that Davis seems to have been aware of an analogy
between the custom of Ireland and Wales, and yet that he only quotes the
statute of Rutland (12 Edw. I.), which by itself does not prove it. It is,
however, proved, if I understand the passage, by one of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Walliæ</span></i>
published by Wotton, p. 139. A gavel or partition was made on the death
of every member of a family for three generations, after which none could
be enforced. But these parceners were to be all in the same degree; so
that nephews could not compel their uncle to a partition, but must wait
till his death, when they were to be put on an equality with their cousins;
and this, I suppose, is meant by the expression in the statute of Rutland,
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod hæreditates remaneant partibiles inter <i>consimiles hæredes</i></span>."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_466" id="Footnote_466" href="#FNanchor_466"><span class="label">[466]</span></a>
 Leland seems to favour the authenticity of the supposed Brehon laws
published by Vallancey. Introduction, 29. The style is said to be very
distinguishable from the Irish of the twelfth or thirteenth century, and the
laws themselves to have no allusion to the settlement of foreigners in
Ireland, or to coined money; whence some ascribe them to the eighth
century. On the other hand, Ledwich proves that some parts must be
later than the tenth century. <i>Dissertations</i>, i. 270. And others hold them
to be not older than the thirteenth. Campbell's <i>Historical Sketch of
Ireland</i>, 41. It is also maintained that they are very unfaithfully translated.
But, when we find the Anglo-Saxon and Norman usages, relief, aid,
wardship, trial by jury (and that unanimous), and a sort of correspondence
in the ranks of society with those of England (which all we read elsewhere
of the ancient Irish seems to contradict), it is impossible to resist the
suspicion that they are either extremely interpolated, or were compiled in
a late age, and among some of the septs who had most intercourse with
the English. We know that the degenerate colonists, such as the Earls of
Desmond, adopted the Brehon law in their territories; but this would
probably be with some admixture of that to which they had been used.</p>

 "The first pile of lime and stone that ever was in Ireland was the castle
of Tuam, built in 1161 by Roderic O'Connor, the monarch." Introduction
to Cox's <i>History of Ireland</i>. I do not find that any later writer controverts
this, so far as the aboriginal Irish are concerned; but doubtless the
Norwegian Ostmen had stone churches, and there seems little doubt that
some at least of the famous round towers so common in Ireland were
erected by them. See Ledwich's <i>Dissertations</i>, vii. 143; and the book
called Grose's <i>Antiquities of Ireland</i>, also written by Ledwich. Piles of
stone without mortar are excluded by Cox's expression. In fact, the Irish
had very few stone houses, or even regular villages and towns, before the
time of James I. Davis, 170.</p>

some of the central districts, all Ireland was shire-ground, and subject to
the Crown in the thirteenth century, however it might fall away in the two
next. Those who write confusedly about this subject, pretend that the
authority of the king at no time extended beyond the pale; whereas that
name was not known, I believe, till the fifteenth century. Under the great
Earl of Pembroke, who died in 1219, the whole island was perhaps nearly
as much reduced under obedience as in the reign of Elizabeth. Leland, 205.</p>

 "There were two other customs proper and peculiar to the Irishry,
which, being the cause of many strong combinations and factions, do tend
to the utter ruin of a commonwealth. The one was <i>fostering</i>, the other
<i>gossipred</i>; both which have ever been of greater estimation among this
people than with any other nation in the Christian world. For fostering
I did never hear or read that it was in that use or reputation in any other
country, barbarous or civil, as it hath been, and yet is, in Ireland, where
they put away all their children to fosterers; the potent and rich men
selling, the meaner sort, buying, the alterage and nursing of their children;
and the reason is, because in the opinion of this people, <i>fostering</i> hath
always been a stronger alliance than blood; and the foster-children do
love and are beloved of their foster-fathers and their sept, more than of
their own natural parents and kindred, and do participate of their means
more frankly, and do adhere to them in all fortunes, with more affection
and constancy. The like may be said of <i>gossipred</i> or compaternity, which
though by the canon law it be a spiritual affinity, and a juror that was
gossip to either of the parties might in former times have been challenged,
as not indifferent, by our law, yet there was no nation under the sun that
ever made so religious an account of it as the Irish," Davis, 179.</p>

 "For that now there is no diversity in array between the English

the Irish enemies do come from day to day into the English counties as
English marchers, and do rob and kill by the highways, and destroy the
common people by lodging upon them in the nights, and also do kill the
husbands in the nights and do take their goods to the Irish men; wherefore
it is ordained and agreed, that no manner man that will be taken for an

have no hairs upon his upper lip, so that the said lip be once at least
shaven every fortnight, or of equal growth with the nether lip. And if

The English were also expelled from Munster, except the walled towns.
The king had no profit out of Ulster, but the manor of Carlingford, nor
any in Connaught. This treatise, written about 1530, is printed in Harris's

were confined to the four shires, are abundant. It is even mentioned in
a statute, 13 H. 8, c. 2.</p>

other statutes. In one passed five years afterwards, it is recited that "the
king's English subjects, by reason that they are inhabited in so little
compass or circuit, and restrained by statute to marry with the Irish nation,
and therefore of necessity must marry themselves together, so that in
effect they all for the most part must be allied together; and therefore it
is enacted, that consanguinity or affinity beyond the fourth degree shall

 Leland gives several instances of breach of faith in the government.
A little tract, called a "Brief Declaration of the Government of Ireland,"
written by Captain Lee in 1594, and published in <i>Desiderata Curiosa
Hibernica</i>, vol. i., censures the two last deputies (Grey and Fitzwilliams)
for their ill usage of the Irish, and unfolds the despotic character of the
English government. "The cause they (the lords of the north) have to
stand upon those terms, and to seek for better assurance, is the harsh
practices used against others, by those who have been placed in authority
to protect men for your majesty's service, which they have greatly abused
in this sort. They have drawn unto them by protection three or four
hundred of the country people, under colour to do your majesty service,
and brought them to a place of meeting, where your garrison soldiers
were appointed to be, who have there most dishonourably put them all to
the sword; and this hath been by the consent and practice of the lord
deputy for the time being. If this be a good course to draw those savage
people to the state to do your majesty service, and not rather to enforce
them to stand on their guard, I leave to your majesty."&mdash;P. 90. He
goes on to enumerate more cases of hardship and tyranny; many being
arraigned and convicted of treason on slight evidence; many assaulted and
killed by the sheriffs on commissions of rebellion; others imprisoned and
kept in irons; among others, a youth, the heir of a great estate. He
certainly praises Tyrone more than, from subsequent events, we should
think just, which may be thought to throw some suspicion on his own
loyalty; yet he seems to have been a protestant, and in 1594 the views of
Tyrone were ambiguous, so that Captain Lee may have been deceived.</p>

superior Irish; and imputes, I believe with much justice, a great part of

bards: "whomsoever they find to be most licentious of life, most bold and
lawless in his doings, most dangerous and desperate in all parts of disobedience
and rebellious disposition, him they set up and glorify in their
rhymes, him they praise to the people, and to young men make an example

flail, which indeed was unsparingly employed to crush rebellion. Grey's
severity was signalised in putting to death seven hundred Spaniards who
had surrendered at discretion in the fort of Smerwick. Though this might
be justified by the strict laws of war (Philip not being a declared enemy)
it was one of those extremities which justly revolt the common feelings of
mankind. The queen is said to have been much displeased at it. Leland,

Sidney was much disappointed at the queen's want of firmness; but it is
plain by the correspondence that Walsingham also thought he had gone
too far. P. 192. The sum required seems to have been reasonable, about
£2000 a year from the five shires of the pale; and, if they had not been
stubborn, he thought all Munster also, except the Desmond territories,
would have submitted to the payment. P. 183. "I have great cause,"
he writes, "to mistrust the fidelity of the greatest number of the people of
this country's birth of all degrees; they be papists, as I may well term
them, body and soul. For not only in matter of religion they be Romish,
but for government they will change, to be under a prince of their own
superstition. Since your highness' reign the papists never showed such
boldness as now they do."&mdash;P. 184. This, however, hardly tallies with
what he says afterwards (p. 208): "I do believe, for far the greatest number
of the inhabitants of the English pale, her highness hath as true and faithful
subjects as any she hath subject to the Crown;" unless the former passage
refer chiefly to those without the pale, who in fact were exclusively concerned
in the rebellions of this reign.</p>

 "The church is now so spoiled," says Sir Henry Sidney in 1576, "as
well by the ruin of the temples, as the dissipation and embezzling of the
patrimony, and most of all for want of sufficient ministers, as so deformed
and overthrown a church there is not, I am sure, in any region where Christ
is professed." <i>Sidney Papers</i>, i. 109. In the diocese of Meath, being the
best inhabited country of all the realm, out of 224 parish churches, 105
were impropriate having only curates, of whom but eighteen could speak
English, the rest being Irish rogues, who used to be papists; fifty-two
other churches had vicars, and fifty-two more were in better state than
the rest, yet far from well. <i>Id.</i> 112. Spenser gives a bad character of the
protestant clergy. P. 412.</p>

<p class="footnote">An act was passed (12 Eliz. c. 1) for erecting free schools in every diocese,
under English masters; the ordinary paying one-third of the salary, and
the clergy the rest. This, however, must have been nearly impracticable.
Another act (13 Eliz. c. 4) enables the Archbishop of Armagh to grant
leases of his lands out of the pale for a hundred years without assent of the
dean and chapter, to persons of English birth, "or of the English and
civil nation, born in this realm of Ireland," at the rent of 4<i>d.</i> an acre. It
recites the chapter to be "except a very few of them, both by nation,
education, and custom, Irish, Irishly affectioned, and small hopes of their
conformities or assent into any such devices as would tend to the placing
of any such number of civil people there, to the disadvantage or bridling
of the Irish." In these northern parts, the English and protestant
interests had so little influence that the pope conferred three bishoprics,
Derry, Clogher, and Raphoe, throughout the reign of Elizabeth. Davis,
254; Leland, ii. 248. What is more remarkable is, that two of these
prelates were summoned to parliament in 1585 (<i>Id.</i> 295); the first in which
some Irish were returned among the Commons.</p>

<p class="footnote">The reputation of the protestant church continued to be little better in
the reign of Charles I., though its revenues were much improved. Strafford
gives the clergy a very bad character in writing to Laud. Vol. i. 187.
And Burnet's <i>Life of Bedell</i>, transcribed chiefly from a contemporary
memoir, gives a detailed account of that bishop's diocese (Kilmore), which
will take off any surprise that might be felt at the slow progress of the
reformation. He had about fifteen protestant clergy, but all English,
unable to speak the tongue of the people, or to perform any divine offices,
or converse with them, "which is no small cause of the continuance of the
people in popery still."&mdash;P. 47. The bishop observed, says his biographer,
"with much regret, that the English had all along neglected the Irish as
a nation not only conquered but undisciplinable; and that the clergy had
scarce considered them as a part of their charge; but had left them wholly
into the hands of their own priests, without taking any other care of them
but the making them pay their tithes. And indeed their priests were a
strange sort of people, that knew generally nothing but the reading their
offices, which were not so much as understood by many of them; and they
taught the people nothing but the saying their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">paters</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aves</span> in Latin."&mdash;P.
114. Bedell took the pains to learn himself the Irish language; and
though he could not speak it, composed the first grammar ever made of it;
had the common prayer read every Sunday in Irish, circulated catechisms,
engaged the clergy to set up schools, and even undertook a translation of
the Old Testament, which he would have published but for the opposition
of Laud and Strafford. P. 121.</p>

 Leland, 414, etc. In a letter from six catholic lords of the pale to the
king in 1613, published in <i>Desiderata Curiosa Hibernica</i>, i. 158, they
complain of the oath of supremacy, which, they say, had not been much
imposed under the queen, but was now for the first time enforced in the
remote parts of the country; so that the most sufficient gentry were
excluded from magistracy, and meaner persons, if conformable, put
instead. It is said on the other side, that the laws against recusants were
very little enforced, from the difficulty of getting juries to present them.
<i>Id.</i> 359. Carte's <i>Ormond</i>, 33. But this at least shows that there was some
disposition to molest the catholics on the part of the government; and it
is admitted that they were excluded from offices, and even from practising
at the bar, on account of the oath of supremacy. <i>Id.</i> 320; and compare
the letter of six catholic lords with the answer of lord deputy and council
in the same volume.</p>

<i>Life of Ormond</i>, i. 14; Leland, 418. It had long been an object with the
English government to extinguish the Irish tenures and laws. Some steps
towards it were taken under Henry VIII.; but at that time there was too
great a repugnance among the chieftains. In Elizabeth's instructions to
the Earl of Sussex on taking the government in 1560, it is recommended that
the Irish should surrender their estates, and receive grants in tail male,
but no greater estate. <i>Desiderata Curiosa Hibernica</i>, i. 1. This would
have left a reversion in the Crown, which could not have been cut off, I
believe, by suffering a recovery. But as those who held by Irish tenure
had probably no right to alienate their lands, they had little cause to
complain. An act in 1569 (12 Eliz. c. 4), reciting the greater part of the
Irish to have petitioned for leave to surrender their lands, authorises the
deputy by advice of the privy council to grant letters patent to the Irish
and degenerate English, yielding certain reservations to the queen. Sidney
mentions, in several of his letters, that the Irish were ready to surrender
their lands. Vol. i. 94, 105, 165.</p>

<p class="footnote">The act 11 Jac. 1, c. 5, repeals divers statutes that treat the Irish as
enemies, some of which have been mentioned above. It takes all the
king's subjects under his protection to live by the same law. Some
vestiges of the old distinctions remained in the statute-book, and were
eradicated in Strafford's parliament. 10 &amp; 11 Car. 1, c. 6.</p>

approaching rebellion is remarkably predicted. "The next rebellion,
whensoever it shall happen, doth threaten more danger to the state than
any that hath preceded; and my reasons are these: 1. They have the
same bodies they ever had; and therein they have and had advantage over
us. 2. From their infancies they have been and are exercised in the use
of arms. 3. The realm, by reason of long peace, was never so full of youth
as at this present. 4. That they are better soldiers than heretofore, their
continual employments in the wars abroad assure us; and they do conceive
that their men are better than ours. 5. That they are more politic, and
able to manage rebellion with more judgment and dexterity than their
elders, their experience and education are sufficient. 6. They will give
the first blow; which is very advantageous to them that will give it.
7. The quarrel for the which they rebel will be under the veil of religion
and liberty, than which nothing is esteemed so precious in the hearts of
men. 8. And lastly, their union is such, as not only the old English dispersed
abroad in all parts of the realm, but the inhabitants of the pale
cities and towns, are as apt to take arms against us, which no precedent
time hath ever seen, as the ancient Irish."&mdash;Vol. i. 432. "I think that
little doubt is to be made, but that the modern English and Scotch would
in an instant be massacred in their houses."&mdash;P. 438. This rebellion the
author expected to be brought about by a league with Spain and with aid
from France.</p>

 The famous parliament of Kilkenny, in 1367, is said to have been very
numerously attended. Leland, i. 319. We find indeed an act (10 H. 7,
c. 23) annulling what was done in a preceding parliament, for this reason,
among others, that the writs had not been sent to all the shires, but to
four only. Yet it appears that the writs would not have been obeyed in
that age.</p>

 In the letter of the lords of the pale to King James above mentioned,
they express their apprehension that the erecting so many insignificant
places to the rank of boroughs was with the view of bringing on fresh penal
laws in religion; "and so the general scope and institution of parliament
frustrated; they being ordained for the assurance of the subjects not to be
pressed with any new edicts or laws, but such as should pass with their
general consents and approbations."&mdash;P. 158. The king's mode of replying
to this constitutional language was characteristic. "What is it to you
whether I make many or few boroughs? My council may consider the
fitness, if I require it. But what if I had created 40 noblemen and 400
boroughs? The more the merrier, the fewer the better cheer." <i>Desid.

 Leland, iii. 4 <i>et post</i>. A vehement protestation of the bishops about
this time, with Usher at their head, against any connivance at popery, is
a disgrace to their memory. It is to be met with in many books. Strafford,
however, was far from any real liberality of sentiment. His abstinence
from religious persecution was intended to be temporary, as the motives
whereon it was founded. "It will be ever far forth of my heart to conceive
that a conformity in religion is not above all other things principally to
be intended. For undoubtedly till we be brought all under one form of
divine service, the Crown is never safe on this side, etc. It were too much
at once to distemper them by bringing plantations upon them, and disturbing
them in the exercise of their religion, so long as it be without
scandal; and so indeed very inconsiderate, as I conceive, to move in this
latter, till that former be fully settled, and by that means the protestant
party become by much the stronger, which in truth I do not yet conceive
it to be." <i>Straff. Letters</i>, ii. 39. He says, however, and I believe truly,
that no man had been touched for conscience' sake since he was deputy.
<i>Id.</i> 112. Every parish, as we find by Bedell's <i>Life</i>, had its priest and mass-house;
in some places mass was said in the churches; the Romish bishops
exercised their jurisdiction, which was fully obeyed; but "the priests
were grossly ignorant and openly scandalous, both for drunkenness and
all sort of lewdness."&mdash;P. 41, 76. More than ten to one in his diocese, the

 The protestants, he wrote word, had a majority of eight in the Commons.
He told them, "it was very indifferent to him what resolution
the house might take; that there were two ends he had in view, and one
he would infallibly attain&mdash;either a submission of the people to his majesty's
just demands, or a just occasion of breach, and either would content the
king; the first was undeniably and evidently best for them."&mdash;<i>Id.</i> 277, 278.
In his speech to the two houses, he said, "His majesty expects not to find
you muttering, or to name it more truly, mutinying in corners. I am
commanded to carry a very watchful eye over these private and secret
conventicles, to punish the transgression with a heavy and severe hand;
therefore it behoves you to look to it."&mdash;<i>Id.</i> 289. "Finally," he concludes,
"I wish you had a right judgment in all things; yet let me not prove a
Cassandra amongst you, to speak truth and not be believed. However,
speak truth I will, were I to become your enemy for it. Remember
therefore that I tell you, you may easily make or mar this parliament. If
you proceed with respect, without laying clogs and conditions upon the
king, as wise men and good subjects ought to do, you shall infallibly set
up this parliament eminent to posterity, as the very basis and foundation
of the greatest happiness and prosperity that ever befell this nation. But,
if you meet a great king with narrow circumscribed hearts, if you will needs
be wise and cautious above the moon [sic], remember again that I tell you,
you shall never be able to cast your mists before the eyes of a discerning
king; you shall be found out; your sons shall wish they had been the
children of more believing parents; and in a time when you look not for
it, when it will be too late for you to help, the sad repentance of an unadvised
heart shall be yours, lasting honour shall be my master's."</p>

 Sir Henry Vane communicated to the lords justices, by the king's
command, March 16, 1640-1, that advice had been received and confirmed
by the ministers in Spain and elsewhere, which "deserved to be seriously
considered, and an especial care and watchfulness to be had therein: that
of late there have passed from Spain (and the like may well have been from
other parts) an unspeakable number of Irish churchmen for England and
Ireland, and some good old soldiers, under pretext of asking leave to raise
men for the King of Spain; whereas, it is observed among the Irish friars
there, a whisper was, as if they expected a rebellion in Ireland, and particularly
in Connaught." Carte's <i>Ormond</i>, iii. 30. This letter, which
Carte seems to have taken from a printed book, is authenticated in
<i>Clarendon State Papers</i>, ii. 143. I have mentioned in another part of this
work (Chap. VIII.) the provocations which might have induced the cabinet
of Madrid to foment disturbances in Charles's dominions. The lords
justices are taxed by Carte with supineness in paying no attention to this
letter (vol. i. 166); but how he knew that they paid none seems hard to say.</p>

<p class="footnote">Another imputation has been thrown on the Irish government and on the
parliament, for objecting to permit levies to be made for the Spanish
service out of the army raised by Strafford, and disbanded in the spring of
1641, which the king had himself proposed. Carte, i. 133; and Leland, 82,
who follows the former implicitly, as he always does. The events indeed
proved that it would have been far safer to let those soldiers, chiefly
catholics, enlist under a foreign banner; but considering the long connection
of Spain with that party, and the apprehension always entertained
that the disaffected might acquire military experience in her service, the
objection does not seem so very unreasonable.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_544" id="Footnote_544" href="#FNanchor_544"><span class="label">[544]</span></a>
 The fullest writer on the Irish rebellion is Carte, in his <i>Life of Ormond</i>,
who had the use of a vast collection of documents belonging to that noble
family; a selection from which forms this third volume. But he is
extremely partial against all who leaned to the parliamentary or puritan
side, and especially the lords justices, Parsons and Borlase; which renders
him, to say the least, a very favourable witness for the catholics. Leland,
with much candour towards the latter, but a good deal of the same
prejudice against the presbyterians, is little more than the echo of Carte.
A more vigorous, though less elegant historian, is Warner, whose impartiality
is at least equal to Leland's, and who may perhaps, upon the whole,
be reckoned the best modern authority. Sir John Temple's <i>History of
Irish Rebellion</i>, and Lord Clanricarde's <i>Letters</i>, with a few more of less
importance, are valuable contemporary testimonies.</p>

<p class="footnote">The catholics themselves might better leave their cause to Carte and
Leland than excite prejudices instead of allaying them by such a tissue
of misrepresentation and disingenuousness as Curry's <i>Historical Account
of the Civil Wars in Ireland</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_545" id="Footnote_545" href="#FNanchor_545"><span class="label">[545]</span></a>
 Sir John Temple reckons the number of protestants murdered, or
destroyed in some manner, from the breaking out of the rebellion in
October 1641, to the cessation in September 1643, at three hundred
thousand, an evident and enormous exaggeration; so that the first
edition being incorrectly printed, and with numerals, we might almost
suspect a cipher to have been added by mistake (p. 15, edit. Maseres).
Clarendon says forty or fifty thousand were murdered in the first insurrection.
Sir William Petty, in his <i>Political Anatomy of Ireland</i>, from calculations
too vague to deserve confidence, puts the number massacred at
thirty-seven thousand. Warner has scrutinised the examinations of witnesses,
taken before a commission appointed in 1643, and now deposited
in the library of Trinity College, Dublin; and, finding many of the depositions
unsworn, and others founded on hearsay, has thrown more doubt
than any earlier writer on the extent of the massacre. Upon the whole,
he thinks twelve thousand lives of protestants the utmost that can be
allowed for the direct or indirect effects of the rebellion, during the two
first years, except losses in war (<i>History of Irish Rebellion</i>, p. 397), and of
these only one-third by murder. It is to be remarked, however, that no
distinct accounts could be preserved in formal depositions of so promiscuous
a slaughter, and that the very exaggerations show its tremendous nature.
The Ulster colony, a numerous and brave people, were evidently unable
to make head for a considerable time against the rebels; which could
hardly have been, if they had only lost a few thousands. It is idle to
throw an air of ridicule (as is sometimes attempted) on the depositions,
because they are mingled with some fabulous circumstances, such as the
appearance of the ghosts of the murdered on the bridge at Cavan; which
by the way, is only told, in the depositions subjoined to Temple, as the
report of the place, and was no cold-blooded fabrication, but the work of
a fancy bewildered by real horrors.</p>

<p class="footnote">Carte, who dwells at length on every circumstance unfavourable to the
opposite party, despatches the Ulster massacre in a single short paragraph,
and coolly remarks, that there were not many murders, "<i>considering the
nature of such an affair</i>," in the first week of the insurrection. <i>Life of
Ormond</i>, i. 175-177. This is hardly reconcilable to fair dealing. Curry
endeavours to discredit even Warner's very moderate estimate; and
affects to call him in one place (p. 184) "a writer highly prejudiced against
the insurgents," which is grossly false. He praises Carte and Nalson, the
only protestants he does praise, and bestows on the latter the name of
impartial. I wonder he does not say that no one protestant was murdered.
Dr. Lingard has lately given a short account of the Ulster rebellion (<i>Hist.
of England</i>, x. 154), omitting all mention of the massacre, and endeavouring
in a note at the end of the volume, to disprove, by mere scraps of quotation,
an event of such notoriety, that we must abandon all faith in public fame
if it were really unfounded.</p>

 Carte, i. 253, 266; iii. 51; Leland, 154. Sir Charles Coote and Sir
William St. Leger are charged with great cruelties in Munster. The
catholic confederates spoke with abhorrence of the Ulster massacre.
Leland, 161; Warner, 203. They behaved, in many parts, with humanity;
nor indeed do we find frequent instances of violence, except in those
counties where the proprietors had been dispossessed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_547" id="Footnote_547" href="#FNanchor_547"><span class="label">[547]</span></a>
 Carte and Leland endeavour to show that the Irish of the pale were
driven into rebellion by the distrust of the lords justices, who refused to
furnish them with arms, after the revolt in Ulster, and permitted the
parliament to sit for one day only, in order to publish a declaration against
the rebels. But the prejudice of these writers is very glaring. The
insurrection broke out in Ulster, October 23, 1641; and in the beginning
of December the lords of the pale were in arms. Surely this affords some
presumptions that Warner has reason to think them privy to the rebellion,
or, at least, not very averse to it. P. 146. And, with the suspicion that
might naturally attach to all Irish catholics, could Borlase and Parsons
be censurable for declining to intrust them with arms, or rather for doing
so with some caution? Temple, 56. If they had acted otherwise, we
should certainly have heard of their incredible imprudence. Again, the
catholic party, in the House of Commons, were so cold in their loyalty, to
say the least, that they objected to giving any appellation to the rebels
worse than that of discontented gentlemen. Leland, 140. See too
Clanricarde's <i>Letters</i>, p. 33, etc. In fact, several counties of Leinster and
Connaught were in arms before the pale.</p>

<p class="footnote">It has been thought by some that the lords justices had time enough to
have quelled the rebellion in Ulster before it spread farther. Warner, 130.
Of this, as I conceive, we should not pretend to judge confidently. Certain
it is that the whole army in Ireland was very small, consisting of only
nine hundred and forty-three horse, and two thousand two hundred and
ninety-seven foot. Temple, 32; Carte, 194. I think Sir John Temple
has been unjustly depreciated; he was master of the rolls in Ireland at the
time, and a member of the council&mdash;no bad witness for what passed in
Dublin; and he makes out a complete justification, as far as appears, for
the conduct of the lords justices and council towards the lords of the pale
and the catholic gentry. Nobody alleges that Parsons and Borlase were
men of as much energy as Lord Strafford; but those who sit down in their
closets, like Leland and Warner, more than a century afterwards, to lavish
the most indignant contempt on their memory, should have reflected a
little on the circumstances.</p>

 "I perceived (says Preston, general of the Irish, writing to Lord
Clanricarde) that the catholic religion, the rights and prerogatives of his
majesty, my dread sovereign, the liberties of my country, and whether
there should be an Irishman or no, were the prizes at stake." Carte iii.
120. Clanricarde himself expresses to the king, and to his brother, Lord
Essex, in January 1642, his apprehension that the English parliament
meant to make it a religious war. Clanricarde's <i>Letters</i>, 61 <i>et post</i>. The
letters of this great man, perhaps the most unsullied character in the annals
of Ireland, and certainly more so than even his illustrious contemporary,
the Duke of Ormond, exhibit the struggles of a noble mind between love
of his country and his religion on the one hand, loyalty and honour on the
other. At a later period of that unhappy war, he thought himself able to

 The statements of lands forfeited and restored, under the execution
of the act of settlement, are not the same in all writers. Sir William
Petty estimates the superficies of Ireland at 10,500,000 Irish acres (being
to the English measure nearly as eight to thirteen), whereof 7,500,000 are
of good land, the rest being moor, bog, and lake. In 1641, the estates of
the protestant owners and of the church were about one-third of these
cultivable lands, those of catholics two-thirds. The whole of the latter
were seized or sequestered by Cromwell and the parliament. After
summing up the allotments made by the commissioners under the act of
settlement, he concludes that, in 1672, the English, protestants, and church
have 5,140,000 acres, and the papists nearly half as much. <i>Political
Anatomy of Ireland</i>, C. 1. In Lord Orrery's <i>Letters</i>, i. 187 <i>et post</i>, is a statement,
which seems not altogether to tally with Sir William Petty's; nor
is that of the latter clear and consistent in all its computations. Lawrence,
author of "The Interest of Ireland Stated," a treatise published in 1682,
says, "Of 10,868,949 acres, returned by the last survey of Ireland, the
Irish papists are possessed but of 2,041,108 acres, which is but a small
matter above the fifth part of the whole."&mdash;Part ii. p. 48. But, as it is
evidently below one-fifth, there must be some mistake. I suspect that in
one of these sums he reckoned the whole extent, and in the other only
cultivable lands. Lord Clare, in his celebrated speech on the Union,
greatly over-rates the confiscations.</p>

<p class="footnote">Petty calculates that above 500,000 of the Irish "perished and were
wasted by the sword, plague, famine, hardship, and banishment, between
the 23rd day of October 1641, and the same day 1652;" and conceives
the population of the island in 1641 to have been nearly 1,500,000, including
protestants. But his conjectures are prodigiously vague.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_554" id="Footnote_554" href="#FNanchor_554"><span class="label">[554]</span></a>
 Petty is as ill satisfied with the restoration of lands to the Irish, as they
could be with the confiscations. "Of all that claimed innocency, seven in
eight obtained it. The restored persons have more than what was their
own in 1641, by at least one-fifth. Of those adjudged innocents, not one
in twenty were really so."</p>

 M. Mazure has brought this remarkable fact to light. Bonrepos, a
French emissary in England, was authorised by his court to proceed in a
negotiation with Tyrconnel for the separation of the two islands, in case
that a protestant should succeed to the crown of England. He had
accordingly a private interview with a confidential agent of the lord
lieutenant at Chester, in the month of October 1687. Tyrconnel undertook
that in less than a year everything should be prepared. <i>Id.</i> ii. 281,

 Such conversions were naturally distrusted. Boulter expresses alarm
at the number of pseudo-protestants who practised the law; and a bill was
actually passed to disable any one, who had not professed that religion for
five years, from acting as a barrister or solicitor. <i>Letters</i>, i. 226. "The
practice of the law, from the top to the bottom, is almost wholly in the
hands of these converts."</p>

Ireland to Archbishop Herring, in the British Museum (Sloane MSS. 4164,

laws, which the catholics were supposed to be attempting; and says they
had the exercise of their religion as openly as the protestants, and monasteries
in many places.</p>

 Sir William Petty, in 1672, reckons the inhabitants of Ireland at
1,100,000; of whom 200,000 English, and 100,000 Scots; above half the
former being of the established church. <i>Political Anatomy of Ireland</i>,
chap. ii. It is sometimes said in modern times, though very erroneously,
that the presbyterians form a majority of protestants in Ireland; but their
proportion has probably diminished since the beginning of the eighteenth
century.</p>

 Journals, 27th June 1698; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> v. 1181. They resolved at the
same time that the conduct of the Irish parliament, in pretending to
re-enact a law made in England expressly to bind Ireland, had given
occasion to these dangerous positions. On the 30th of June they addressed
the king in consequence, requesting him to prevent anything of the like
kind in future. In this address, as first drawn, the legislative authority of
the <i>kingdom of England</i> is asserted. But this phrase was omitted afterwards,
I presume, as rather novel; though by doing so they destroyed
the basis of their proposition, which could stand much better on the new
theory of the constitution than the ancient.</p>
